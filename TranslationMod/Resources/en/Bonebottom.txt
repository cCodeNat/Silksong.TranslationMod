BB_FIXER_ACT3_MEET : Ah, virgin! Of course, all this has remained! It seems so true. Unfortunately, I can't say that you are particularly lucky. Even the beautiful camp below was once plundered by the Dark Death, but no worm is safe now. It's not a very safe place, but I'm glad some of you are staying. I'm trying to improve things as much as I can. Want to send this world out of control? This is a great project, girl. I don't think the worm can stop these things, but it's nice to know there's always something new. Feel free to relax with us. The most we can ask for right now is a little friendship.
BB_FIXER_DELIVERY : We are bringing your majesty supplies from Bello Villa to help your camp and population. Ah! Thank you all. Most people bring a table. It will be a little easier if you bring them.
MOSSCREEP_MEET_ALT : That's right! Who are you, intruder? Annoying! Annoying, useless droid! There was nothing wrong with you, droid. Your smile bothered me, so I went to find out. What is this smile? I don't understand. How ridiculous!
BB_CARETAKER_BASEMENT_REPEAT : Hunter, may your journey bring you joy. And may the court fear you, for you have freed us from our chains.
BELLWAY_PILGRIM_MEET_2 : Huh? Oh, again? Quit the paper and travel. Hide. Yes, of course. I don't want to disturb you. Did you come here to rest before the trip? Will you die like your brothers? No, maybe you'll stay here a little longer, you see...
BB_RESIDENT_GOT_SILKSPEAR : Access to the village from the outside is prohibited. Only monsters and madmen lurk in the dark. But I have heard that this place is safe. A little further down, where moss grows on the stones, is an ancient seat. It seems well preserved, like a holy place. I have visited the village I mentioned. There is a structure around the cemetery that contains the corpse of an ancient weaver. However, I cannot say that it is safe. The area is dangerous and hunters roam this wasteland. I think it's best to stay away. Yes... absolutely. Is there any place that is not dangerous? Tradition among outsiders...
FUNERAL_2 : As pilgrims, we strive to reach the summit and not lose ourselves, but when we lose our brothers and sisters, our hands and feet tremble.
BB_CARETAKER_REPEAT : Hunter, there are very few people as crazy as you. You can join us anytime. I can't wait to see what changes your actions will bring to our world. Exactly!
MOSSCREEP_COMPLETED_ACT3 : Oh, the earth is shaking! But I hear... a low number... a low number.
MOSSCREEP_REFUSE : Grant refused! I know Grantir is truly evil. This is a terrible thing! When he calms down, come back here. Come back and fulfill my wish!
BELLWAY_PILGRIM_MEET_1 : Ah... Are you still hiding here? The world outside is scary. If you're going to keep quiet, I'd love to come with you. Woman, it's a strange place to rest. This clock and the buildings around it... they remind me of the foundations of a lost city. Ah! They say in the camp that this beetle is spreading across the earth, like veins of ore mined by our ancestors. They even say that insects fly on golden chariots! Such a wonderful trip, shame on the outsiders. We have to walk, climb and crawl on our toes.
BB_FIXER_Q1_UNACCEPTED : "Listen, do you make a wish on the moon? Did you notice I added a really banal wish? I did well, never mind. I guess I'll grant my first wish for the kingdom."
MOSSCREEP_DONT_GIVE : Just for her? Hmmm! She broke her promise! She broke her promise!
BB_RESIDENT_NAME : Didn't you tell me your name? How rude! My name is Philby. I am glad to meet you. Please. We haven't talked in a long time. My name is Hornet. Nice to finally meet you. Wasp? What a powerful name. Madam, it suits you very well. He-he...
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_INTRO : Mosbury. Are you still looking? You have fulfilled your desire, but it is clear that you want more! More! More Mosbury. Hmm. They are also changing. Beautiful rose garden and fresh fruit!
MOSSCREEP_CANCOMPLETE : I promise, droid, I bought the fruit. Why do we need such a common fruit? Something ordinary! No, something special, something precious. Only a droid knows! It's a glowstick! It wants true forgiveness. May it be my best!
BB_SHOPKEEP_NOSTOCK_RETURN : We will soon depart for the great palace. Since counting buttons is a sacred activity, the journey will not be difficult.
BB_FIXER_ACT3_DELIVERY_POST : Ah! You cannot return without a reward. Accept this invitation. You no longer need gems, but it would be nice if you could use them.
MOSSCREEP_OFFER : Why did I send you here? What? Did you hear my wish? Are you the one who makes wishes? You? what do you want Let it be! I long for it! The world wants the fruits of your labor, three lovely children. Because it wants them, hop! Didn't the kingdom send you to fulfill my will?
BB_RESIDENT_BELLHART : You have come a long way. The journey was just beginning. It is a shame for a foreigner to stay here so long. But I'm not ashamed. It's your life and you don't have to suffer palace ghosts. Either you go alone or you go. Ha-ha... You are not a true foreigner. Absolutely not. For better or worse, it's an insult. Anyway... whatever you say, it doesn't matter. Maybe I'm not a true foreigner.
BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_ROSARY_MAGNET_DESC : Isn't this stone beautiful? He says it will help him collect pearls. Come back and share it with me.
FUNERAL_NAME_2 : Hi bro, thanks for sharing. Let's sing about the great and mighty Philby.
MOSSCREEP_COMPLETED : Hmm. are you listening Simple, but important. Knock on the door! Light... Spring...
BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_ROSARY_SET_DESC : Are the pockets full of rosaries? Tie them with string to prevent them from coming loose. Although it may seem simple, tying a rosary correctly takes some skill.
BB_RESIDENT_MEET_ALT : What? Now I remember. Camping? Pilgrim, just a tourist? I'm not a stranger, but I've walked this path. Am I not a stranger? And yet. We must all follow this path. He stepped up. But most fall at the door. If you are wise, stay here, rest and return to this dangerous world.
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_ACCEPT_2 : Wow, what a success! They are so fragrant and round. So round! And whoever finds them will be rewarded with a crown of beauty.
BB_SHOPKEEP_MEET : Hi, Mr. Guest! Are you in the palace? Before we board, why don't you go to the stranger's old house and exchange a few things? Master, I want to see the materials, but you can't go back. So don't worry! If you don't have anything good, you can negotiate. Religion is a sacred currency in this country! Rope! Beautifully designed bean balls! Give me something and we'll get what we want.
BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_TOKEN_FAITH_DESC : It looks like a simple key, but I don't know what it unlocks. If it comes from the palace, it must open the sacred door!
BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_TOOLMETAL_DESC : This is an extraordinary creation. More spectacular than you could imagine and more durable than a cake pan. A wise artist with the necessary knowledge can create something truly magnificent.
BB_FIXER_DELIVERY_POST : Feel free to bring a bead to thank you for your presence. You will be richly rewarded.
MOSSCREEP_INGREDIENT : War druid, I'll fetch a pot of berry soup to appease the lords of the castle. Should I join? Hmmm! Will there be bugs in my berry soup? They can't stand such a sour taste! It's ripe! It burns! The taste of happiness and misery! If they taste that bitter, they will also hallucinate. Hallucinations, right? Give me the soup! For the bug, mmm... sharing hallucinations. Yes, let's give!
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_FINAL_2 : Ah! Oh, oh, oh, oh! She smells wonderful though! She is healing! But she is still young! Listen to your sisters and grow up! Oh, they're growing!
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_FINAL_3 : Umm... umm. Are you hallucinating? What does it smell like? Terrible, terrible apples. How cruel! There is already so much fruit. We don't need more. But you are my only friend. My girl, Price! I'll throw away your starch. Yes. The tears of the amulets flow more!
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_FINAL_1 : Oh, what a fruit! How precious! Maybe this is enough. That's all! Once it's started, our work is never done!
BB_RESIDENT_PILGRIMSREST : Oh, how good to see you again! It's strange to see familiar faces in such a dangerous place. Greetings, dear brothers. Your journey has started well. Yes, you're already gone. Well, I'm glad you made it out safely. Not quite healthy... Some itching and sunburn. This trip is a highlight, but I've seen so much! An enormous metal structure, fields of fire that seem to stretch into infinity. The scale of this issue is enough to disprove even the mildest of hypocrites. We will rest here for a while and then continue.
MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE : Yes! Yes! This is the precious product we were promised! Look and see! It is ready. Now we can start!
BB_SHOPKEEP_ITEM_MASK_SHARD_DESC : This one is a little more complicated. Goodbye, travelers.
FUNERAL_FINAL_NONAME : Hello, little foreigner. Your arms open the way for others.
BB_FIXER_BENCHREPAIR_REPEAT_ALT : It's all we can do to focus and try.
MOSSCREEP_MEET_ACT3 : Hmm! Is there time? The world trembles with pain! It's looking for a new beat, isn't it? It's looking! It's looking for a new number... The trembling you feel is not the world's pain. It has fallen and destruction will inevitably follow if its sources are not extinguished. what is that No, no, no. The world is asking! It needs a new beat!
BB_CARETAKER_CURSED_REPEAT : Run to the center of the species and there you will find your cousin. If anyone can heal you from what pulls you into your shell, it's him.
MOSSCREEP_INPROGRESS : Yes! Yes! Who are you, son? You don't want that. But we are small fruits. We have three fruits and we have three fruits. Look carefully!
BB_FIXER_BENCHREPAIR : Ah! I'm sure of it! I feared he would get seriously injured fighting the giant monster. I am sorry to leave you in such a dangerous place, but I am no warrior, and my tools would be unfit for such creatures. I'm glad you're safe. This country needs restorers, not soldiers. Hmm, maybe that's true. At a time like this, we can go straight to work and focus on construction.
BB_FIXER_ACT3_REPEAT : Stay with us if you want. We don't have much time left, but we are certainly not alone in our destiny.
BB_FIXER_STATUE : Ah! So nice to meet you. You have worked so hard in these areas. You have done more for yourself than anyone else. I appreciate your efforts and wish you all the best. It's not a big deal! But I gave everything! There will be great support on this solo tour. May this gift be preserved throughout the journey. But you will always be welcome here.
BB_RESIDENT_CAMP : This campsite looks truly terrifying. As the area becomes more dangerous, I worry about our safety. Maybe not now, but there is always a place where migratory insects find refuge. That's faith! Pilgrims, yesterday and today, have always been the same. Our faith is what keeps this camp alive. Whatever happens, this store will be at your service.
FUNERAL_1 : Haji, what is the ritual that unites you? We hold this poor brother in our arms and endure his last bitter steps. From here we have gathered to sing a farewell song to ease the pain of this irreparable loss.
BB_CARETAKER_TALK_02 : If these hidden insects are just your concern, allowing you to enter the forest without fear, are they really special? At home, some people would look at me that way. But here, when my strength is exhausted, I am but a traveler. Ah! Tourist, but how? Now I know! Be careful! Do these hidden insects not realize what they have taken? Are they worried?
MOSSCREEP_REOFFER : I wish it, I wish it! This world needs a blessing: three beautiful children. I need them! Will the little kingdom send you to do my will?
BB_CARETAKER_MEET_1 : Ah, you are finally awake! Tourist, save your energy. It would be a shame to lose an old man like me to the unknown. You know, ma'am. I received a very cold reception in your country. The cause is suspicious.
BB_CARETAKER_PRE_MEET : Be persistent! Stand up! You will not die in the countryside!
BB_CARETAKER_MEET_3 : I'm no stranger, Hornet. I did not come to these countries voluntarily. I was captured and forcibly brought here by new, sharp insects. Ah! How strange! We are insects from above the castle. We hide in our closets or offer something more. If all these insects belong here, let's ask ourselves why. Ah! Goat! Very interesting! You have no strange spirits. Hunter to be seen. Now, brave travelers, welcome to the area! We are in a holy but cursed land. Before we go, a little warning to those elders: Pick up your weapons. Our kingdom is cursed. The path turns out to be rough and dangerous and some try to climb to the top of the hill, but no one comes back to talk.
BB_CARETAKER_MEET_2 : Maybe you are a stranger? Or have you crossed the darkness, walked the path, climbed the golden peak?
BB_FIXER_Q1_COMPLETE : Hey, look! You returned all the shell pieces, just like I asked! I can't believe it! These things are truly priceless. They are perfect for crafts and DIY projects and have so many uses. But not everyone... Is it finally true? If you didn't know this area so well and didn't take full advantage of it, you probably wouldn't be able to. Really? Madam, thank you for your help. Best of luck on your journey. May all your wishes come true!
BB_SHOPKEEP_POST_BOSS : Oh, what an ordeal. Encountering such a monster on the way to paradise! To discover such a world... Ah, we definitely need more buttons. Please, Mr. Peregrine, can you give me something?
MOSSCREEP_WISHWALL : are you my master That's what he wants! I want the fruits of the earth, three lovely children. Because I need them, I want them! You promised me. A bond stronger than sin. Take three moss berries. These are the most precious fruits! Do my will. Then it all starts again!
BB_RESIDENT_PILGRIMSREST_REPEAT : I still have a long way to go and see a lot. But now let me rest a little.
BB_FIXER_GENERIC : Fresh food is always welcome in tough times! Teenagers often come and go without a trace.
BB_SHOPKEEP_NOSTOCK : Come on! I think I decided the last thing with you. Now I have no more excuses to be here. I'm going to the big palace soon. Since I am a saint and we count prayers, I am sure the journey will not be difficult.
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_NOBERRY : Give me more moss. Hmmm. Well, change your clothes. Nice pearls and fresh fruit! Find out where the green moss grows!
BB_CARETAKER_TALK_01 : Hunter, you are skilled with a sword. Your hands are very steady. So even though you still seem a little sick, I don't really believe you. I have been stuck under a foreign seal for some time now. My stamina is low but I will be fine. When we get to the courtroom, I'll be ready to face anything.
BB_CARETAKER_CURSED : Ah! Hunter, how terrible! My body is all tied up, I look worse than when we first met! My body has become home to a deadly parasite. Although I cannot bear it with innate strength, its presence has weakened me considerably. It is impossible! Faram is already under a curse. I can no longer fight myself and suck every drop of life out of me. We must reach the village of Daasi, in the center of the kingdom, as soon as possible. There lurks my uncle, an old sadhu and a terrible deceiver. It is difficult to contact him, but he knows all the problems of the kingdom. If anyone can tell me the cure, it's probably him.
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_ACCEPT_3 : O glorious fruit! And... oh! O wonderful fruit! Ripe! Wonderful fragrance! All around! May you have a bountiful harvest!
BB_SHOPKEEP_MEET_ALT : Hi, Mr. Host! Why don't you stop by and make some money with some old strangers? Sure, you will have something to help you on this wonderful journey!
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_REFUSE : Do you pick fruit yourself? Out of greed? Oh, what a wonderful sight! It would be a lot of pressure.
BB_FIXER_STATUE_REPEAT : Don't let fear hold you back on this journey! It's a lot and few people can do it.
FUNERAL_4 : Let us sing for our brothers who died in love! Their pain and suffering are left behind, like dust from a traveler's scarf.
MOSSCREEP_ACCEPT : This is the promise. A bond stronger than sin. Bring me three musk fruits. The most precious fruits! Do my will. Let's get started!
MOSSCREEP_MEET : Hello! Who are you, intruder? You are so annoying! You are disturbing a useless droid! I didn't mean to interrupt you, droid. Your laugh bothered me so I decided to check. This village is built around an old weaver's house. Do you know Viber? Do you still live here? Which village? What is Viber? Don't be crazy!
BB_CARETAKER_SNARE : At the request of my queen, who lived in a noble castle, I gathered my forces and came back to help and laid a trap. Hey, hunter! The old man is awake. I knew it would be like this; I would have heard it. And how good it was! My family has been in the dark for too long... or is gone! I'm different! When my brother woke up, I was ashamed to admit it. You must choose between fighting for freedom and running into the fire. Ah, hello!
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_ACCEPT_1 : What a fruit! Oh... but! It's not fresh. It's rotten! It smells like death! A little crown for you. Just what I needed!
FUNERAL_NAME_1 : Philby This stranger's name was Philby.
BB_FIXER_REPEAT : According to the will of the moon, snakes can turn to all nearby molluscs for help. So, what do you want to happen?
BB_RESIDENT_REPEAT : Stay here as long as you want. I'm not going back now. It's always nice to spend time with someone.
BELLWAY_PILGRIM_REPEAT : No strange cries are heard here, except the sweet sound of bells. Before I leave, I decide to stop here for a while and reflect.
FUNERAL_FINAL_NAME : Hello, Brother Philby. Let your arms strengthen the footsteps of others.
BELLWAY_PILGRIM_AFTER_TRAVEL : Animals! Animals! Scare the animals!
FUNERAL_3 : ...Hmmm. Do you know the name of this little foreigner?
BB_FIXER_Q1_COMPLETE_R : Shell fragments are common but extremely useful. They can repair almost anything in your shop that needs constant repair.
BB_FIXER_BENCHREPAIR_REPEAT : Is this poor stranger still missing? Just thinking about it makes me crazy. Better to stay out of sight and hold out until the job is done.
BB_RESIDENT_MEET : What? Are you still a stranger, my friend? Shall we walk towards the holy place above the castle? I'm not a stranger, but I believe I've walked the same path. And you? So don't worry. Each of us has our own journey. But most will make sure to go for the royal gates. If you are wise, let's rest a little before we step foot into this dangerous world.
MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_D : Donus and Appianus. Our beloved druids. Or maybe my droid? I don't think I have anything else. I swear this amulet will ease your pain. When your tears are dry, here's an amulet to cry over!
MOSSCREEP_TRADE_BERRY : Yes! Yes! Your fragrance is so sweet and so precious. You are a fruit! Can I prepare it for you?
BB_RESIDENT_TALK : Little stranger, ask yourself: what draws you to this fortress? If the journey is dangerous, then why go on such a journey? This is a strange question for the traveler. The holy land calls. Moving is one of the most important decisions. Who denies that? Driven by our faith, we cross burning fields, trembling deserts and climb golden stairs. All this towards the eternal, luminous fortress. When we are ready, we will rise up and see with our own eyes.
MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_C : Hmm! Hmm! The pain breaks my heart. For what? No fruit, no fruit. O Maya! You are the one I miss. He really wants to come. You gave me what I needed and have always been with me. A friend who overcomes difficulties. I don't need anything more.
MOSSCREEP_QUESTCOMPLETE_B : Ah! On, on, on! What a wonderful smell! Like everyone else! But like the smallest! Ah, the jumping sound! Ah, the queen's dance! On...on! Speak up, so we can hear! Ah! On, on, on!
FUNERAL_2b : Sing, brothers! Let's sing, relieve this pain! Let us sing the name of the poor pilgrim whose journey has begun!
BELLWAY_PILGRIM_TALK_1 : Do you know what keeps you from this camp? At the end of Parus, in the cave of brittle bones. It is full of terrifying creatures and dangerous rocks. It is said that an ancient insect once nested there. Imagine, such a hard and unstable place! I have never met such a strong insect in my life.
BB_PILGRIM_HORNED : My sister, my sister! What are those long, gleaming teeth? Are they weapons? They are indeed weapons, but you must not fear them. I will not use them against you. These swords are for hunters and other enemies. They must use their weapons before boarding the ship. Ah... This is great compassion for strangers, my sister. We must arm ourselves with prayer, surround ourselves with faith, and hope in a higher power. This is our way.
BB_FIXER_Q1_INTRO : Oh! Little pig! The wall will be built! It was built for poor, abandoned souls. It is said in Paruma that true believers can do whatever they want. If only the poor could do what we want. I wish the walls were small and my walls were small! Justice is justice. Nor that the state should comply with my first wish.
BB_FIXER_MEET : what are you doing Is this a sign of something? Oh yes. Fake snakes! It is pure will. There is already an old man in this camp. I thought I'd stick it in the nearby garage. Icy walls are very popular in Palo. They will be there. May many prayers come. Give them some space.
BB_PILGRIM_ROUND_REPEAT : Listen to me carefully... and pray constantly. Only then will my faith grow.
BB_CARETAKER_SNARE_REPEAT : Hunter, I'm not surprised you're so angry. You have a natural instinct for change. You are no ordinary worm! You are no ordinary weaver. If our family is to succeed, we need people like you. Will you show us your faith? We have always looked for other ways. With any luck, maybe you can help us succeed.
FUNERAL_NONAME : This foreign name has been forgotten, but is still pronounced.
BB_RESIDENT_GOT_SPRINT : Terrible rumors spread around the camp. The pilgrims struggle to climb and attack their companions in frustration. You have experienced this yourself. Tell me, is it true? It's a true story. Strangers and animals entangle the trail with a cursed thread that drives them crazy. I have not yet found the origin of this thread. Oh... I was afraid it wouldn't happen. If it did, no one on the road would trust it. The risk of dying alone is terrifying, but the loneliness of the journey seems unbearable... Oh, I can't help it. This will be another test of our faith.
BB_PILGRIM_HORNED_REPEAT : As pilgrims, we can arm ourselves with prayer and have enough faith to be patient. This is our way...
BB_CARETAKER_TALK_03 : What is this old chapel? The building was barely standing, not a single worshiper. Oh! It's gone! Everyone runs away and hides. But I will not let go of this place until everything calms down... Even after the long decline of the country, these farmers do not know that this house exists. So wonderful, so wonderful, so wonderful. Its condition is a sad example to those who dare to oppose it.
BB_FIXER_ACT3_DELIVERY : Really? Is it a blessing? Even in these times, our people truly desire forgiveness! You have been our savior, madam. All these poor people thank you. You are grateful. I hope this article is helpful.
BB_PILGRIM_ROUND : You, in your cloak... walking silently. I meditate and strengthen my faith before I go on a journey. Rest my steps, lady. I didn't mean to upset anyone. Ah... your words are too strong. I can barely hear my own thoughts. Give in...
BB_CARETAKER_BONEGRAVE : It looks like a giant bone inside opened the door without permission! I am curious. In front of him was a large tomb. I thought that most of the worms would die on the way up, but it seems that most of them fall before they start. Sorry! Some of the animals, some of bad luck. Some were weaker. At least these souls will rest together. Death, death, death. An eternal promise of the eternal kingdom. And soon it will be upon us all.
BB_CARETAKER_BASEMENT_TALK_01 : Lord Hunter! You were the one who cleaned the room, right? When I arrived, the nestlings were not happy to let me go. Oh my god, these creatures are so strong! After the eggs hatched and squeezed, the room was a mess. Thanks for letting me know!
