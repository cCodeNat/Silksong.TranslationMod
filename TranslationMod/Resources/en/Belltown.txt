RELIC_DEALER_RELICS_FIRST : what is this It smells! There's still something in there!
DOCTOR_CURSE_FIX_OFFER : Ah! Come on! Master, sir! The time has finally come! Oops! We will free you from your suffering and show you our abilities!
SHOPKEEP_CURSED : Oh, what a mess! I feel like I'm dying, I feel like I'm dying! I try, but it just hurts. It's like a parasite has crawled into my shell... Do you have a cure? Hmm, maybe I didn't leave any out. Paabo Ask He is a leader; maybe he can give you some good advice. But... isn't shopping the cure? Buy something now. In your case, this could be your last chance!
COURIER_SHOP_CURSED_TALK_1 : Ah! what is happening My body is shaking! There's a horrible monster inside! The parasite has burrowed deep into my shell. I can barely contain my anger. This shell will not be able to receive the packet! Remember the stuff you want to save! Good, send it. Since you managed to get rid of the parasite, take care.
BELLHERMIT_MEET : Waiter, who are you? A slave? I am neither a traveler nor a stranger nor a slave. "Yes," said the waiter. "Come out."
GREETER_REPEAT2_ACT3 : Türkiye, this chaos will end soon. Until then, I'll take care of these insects. Yes, dear citizens! Yes! We believe in your faith and your wishes.
SHOP_ITEM_ROSARYSTRING_M_DESC : When I try to put buttons on, they often fall out of my pocket. But I think it's a really great idea! I can link them together like a solid, safe and beautiful necklace.
COURIER_SHORT_QUEST_ACCEPTED : I heard your request. If your sister is safe, I will definitely take her. Thank you so much, girl! You are the strongest! Just like your sister! I have full faith in you!
PINSMITH_QUEST_REPEAT : At the top of the castle, the oil is left for you. Give the blacksmith the pillow; your sword will become stronger. I find a pillow, oil. Dry hands.
DOCTOR_CURSE_OFFER : Hello! what's the matter I've got a parasite inside of me, Buck! Do you know who they are? Yes, the great Jarnawi, who now stands before you, that excellent, unjustly exiled doctor! I'm sorry to interrupt your work, but if you really are the doctor next door that you say you are, I want your cooperation. A parasite crawls inside me. Its roots writhe beneath the bark, eating and draining its strength. If you have the skills and the tools, do it. Stomach! Great, great! So you are a special, weak ideal? Then things change. Of course I'm not wrong! Well, hmm. It's all about us. Not cotton. But something strange has crept in! These roots torment you... I don't know much about them, but they never do! There is something strange in your shell that if I take it out, I will use the Iarnavius ​​Extractor! That's your only hope, Buck! ...Okay, but first I need more strength to break through this hard shell. Yes, I can heal! But first I need to add a powerful extractor!
SHOP_ITEM_SHARD_POUCH : A woman should always have extra money on hand. Our old Bellhearts were known for their exceptional piano skills. Most newer foreigners are not familiar with this art... except you.
BELLHERMIT_SAVED_3 : What stubborn insects! I wonder why I saved those wretched insects from the cursed profit? The creature that once pulled the strings had power. And now Meshi's ability to steal becomes available. This is good because the streets are clean and open again. Sometimes I disagree with these insects, but seeing silkworms with this disgusting service gives me goosebumps. Hmm... it does no good to hand it over. But the concentration of power... we may better understand its purpose.
RELIC_DEALER_RELICS : Ah... there is something strange about you. You seem stuck in the past. Do you have something to give me?
PINSMITH_QUEST_OFFER : You have a strong hand. My needle sings of your sickness. But I have a question for you. Want something sharper? What does Pliny suggest? That would be barbaric! But... maybe? But... you're not in doubt? Is that possible? Is it too much for you? What else should I look for in the state? Wait, please! Yes. You will find excellent quality oil. The needle immediately came from the palace and he sharpened the knives with it. The owner of the needle is long dead, but perhaps there is still something to this miracle. If you steal a drop to give to the cat, your needle will be deceitful... Do you know, my friend, that insects are hiding from ruthless thieves who seek to steal this magnificent work.
SHOP_ITEM_TOOL_POUCH_DESC : Do you have a toolbox? Adding pockets can help you store more tools and DIY supplies. My seamstress listens to me well.
COURIER_SHOP_MEET : Mr. Thrifty! We can finally be together! My brother and I are back safe and sound. I'm so happy to be together again. If you're thinking about adventure, think twice, even about the oysters. i know! Seriously! We cannot leave the territory of this species. That's too much! The oysters have to be here to survive. But instead, let's come up with a plan—how clever! Right? Tourists, passers-by, maybe you can help us? How do you like our little prize? You too, Mr. Thrifty! Of course! There was a meeting. Now listen to our prayers. It's time to move the curtain!
PINSMITH_QUEST_REOFFER : The legendary oil of our profession slumbers in the heavenly citadel... To achieve such a burning edge... But alas! Savage thing. It receives countless blows, frequent, violent blows.
SHOPKEEP_PAINT_POST : Good luck with the painting, Jimin! Just be patient a little longer and your character will leave a lasting impression.
BELLHERMIT_SNARE : Hmm... did the waiter come to you? Listen, do you miss life? Your grandson is there. It seems you have adapted to this. Will you help me, little insect? The network he created requires strength, but you definitely have more than anyone else. Yes, do it. Don't be lucky... Oops! But that won't happen. I am simply releasing this silent energy for you to observe. Many souls have appeared and formed. They have wasted all the generations. It is better to burn.
DOCTOR_DOOR_INSPECT : The doorbell rings. Do you want to call?
DOCTOR_LIFEBLOOD_STATE : Ma'am, a strange force has penetrated my shell. In your country we call it plasma. It helps with regeneration, but I believe my mind is under attack. Ah! Is it good to be attacked? Is that bad? Why do you value your mind so much? This is the great Jernavi, healer of the sick! Pain does not help. Use it and comfort me!
COURIER_SHORT_MEET : Hello, young lady! Thanks again for you and the great sword! I returned to Salvo and despite some difficulties managed to recover the materials. He looked so happy! I don't think I can go any further. There are too many animals here! All of them, all of them. Even strangers! They are all going crazy. Be careful: this city is now safe. The gates remain within the walls; the insect is clever.
COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_1 : Mr. Sheldon, be careful! You and the messenger are very cute creatures!
COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_3 : Don't wait, send a message! I'm waiting for your package, come on! Run like a worm and collect.
COURIER_SHORT_GOURMAND_HINT : Hint: I want an old man who lives in a castle. A cooking vessel that satisfies the stomach of a gourmet. Do you have a bacon necklace in your bag? I think that's the most important thing. Bacon necklace! It's too much for me. I am a frugal person! Fatty, smelly food is usually fine, but it's bad for my sensitive stomach. I want to kill my brother. Great paper! This pill loves bacon! I'm baking new bread, but first I need to find the hair and hide it in a safe place!
DOCTOR_CLOSED_QUEST_END : "Come on! What? Master Jarnavi, you're bothering me again! Lady, I'm back with the hook you asked for. Take that parasite out of its shell."
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_PROMPT : Is the needle buzzing?
PINSMITH_UPGRADED_COMPLETE : This sword! The keys! Do what you can. The lighthouse may grow dark, but your spear will shine in this deep darkness.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_SPA_DESC : Why not cool off in the cold waters of the spa? Even the labs will benefit.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_LIGHTS_DESC : A knotted ball full of hot flies. It will illuminate even the thickest lampshade.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_DUSTPENSSLAVE_RETRY : Another egg. Queen bees hatch after eating contaminated food. A wonderful, magnificent creature emerges from the cockroaches. Maybe this time the trip will be safer than before?
DOCTOR_SLAP_PRE : Mr. Sample, at least try! Is it a secret? Progress is undeniable!
COURIER_SHOP_CURSED_REPEAT : If the package is dirty, you will not get your products back! There is nothing wrong with paying the pollution tax! Well, the messenger. If you can get rid of this error, please help me.
DOCTOR_CURSE_ACCEPT : Boo! Courage! Our perfect awakening! My mission is simple. Make your way through the tangled desert foliage. There are two insects hiding there, Benzin and Kororo. A simple and completely unknown creature. We need an iron spear. Hard and sharp, I have the strongest. It's strong enough to break rocks! And it penetrates even the thickest treetops. Boo! So prepare the carriage for my return, miss. I'll be back soon with the spear. Waiting for your release.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_DESK_NAME : Recommendation
PINSMITH_QUEST_ACCEPT : Needle, I found the oil. My needles have served me very well in this cruel world. New battles await you. I admire your skill with weapons. It is dangerous to accede to the wishes of this poor acupuncturist. I hope his job doesn't cost him his life.
BELLHERMIT_CURSED_REPEAT : If you want to survive the attack, you will find a Yanbei girl who is exiled from Belhart. She was probably somewhere remote, in the desert, for all we know.
RELIC_DEALER_GOT : Yes... this fits my collection perfectly. Look! What I have!
BELLHERMIT_REPEAT : He would not spend any more time with the servants. Go away!
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FIXER_RETRY : Apart from the provisions in the caves, the poor lived. Send for your supplies now! I will come soon.
GREETER_TWISTED_BUD_HINT : "She cried, my sister!" Gray and distorted, but clear and moist. A vineyard, perhaps? Pilgrim In the damp swamp above the stream I looked for the direction of that mournful cry and found it there... as if it were waiting for me. But you warn me of your coming, but you do not see me. Does that sound familiar? Ever heard that cry? Yes! Not yours, but I have occasionally met other travelers who wear something similar. Nothing surprising. They let out a cry and it went to Shelwood's heart. I never heard her cry again. Not a vine, not a merciful worm... If you follow me, I wish you peace, but the return of such a sad voice after so many years is an ominous sign.
RELIC_DEALER_MEET : What? what happened who are you what happened what do you want I've just been wandering around. I hope you are not too worried about the traps the city has set for you. Hmm! I don't care if they have contact with the outside world or not. They have no intelligence and no respect for history! You seem to have talent though. And pain. If you find an ancient and beautiful story, bring it here. I will accept it.
PINSMITH_QUEST_COMPLETED : Alright Paint Master, it's time to start painting!
BELLHERMIT_SAVED_1_ALT : I scream, the voice echoing back from above. Terrible voice. The wire is broken. You... you cut it off. Do not refuse! What do I deny? I killed a terrible beast on the road and rang the silk bell in the silence of the old clock. Are they far away? Far away! As long as I live and breathe I will be happy. Only the dead are happy. You are a slave and a louse... Go!
GREETER_TALK1_ACT3 : Villagers! You are truly unique. You have survived the desert and the darkness, but have returned to us safe and sound. You have recovered a precious hope that you want to share. I have found a way to stop this chaos and have put it into practice immediately. My chances are slim, but if the village succeeds and my efforts are rewarded, then perhaps Farom will have a bright future.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_GRAMAPHONE_DESC : The castle has produced some amazing machines, but this is the best! It's as if the creepy snail lurking there sent one especially to sell you.
RELIC_DEALER_EMPTY : Preserving memories of the past is my passion. Whenever I find something beautiful, ancient or rich in history, I bring it here. I will guard it jealously.
COURIER_SHOP_NOTACCEPTED : Dear Ambassadors, I cannot help you. I have too much to do. My duties are urgent and I have no time to shoulder this burden. With any luck, strangers have arrived. Maybe they will fulfill your wish too. Let's pray they come, madam! My grace is infinite.
BELLHERMIT_SAVED_1 : A cry, a voice echoed from above. What a pitiful cry! The thread is dead. You cut it. Don't deny it! What do I deny? I cut the thread and the demon cursed the city I conquered. Are they far away? Far away! As long as I breathe and live I will be happy. Only the dead are happy. You are a slave and a troublemaker... Go!
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FLEATOPIA : Hi! A group of fleas have gathered in the studio and built a nest, and we pray that something escapes. Even the politest insects eagerly await our birth. Mr. Motors, please make sure the shipment is correct! To thank the fleas, always do something right.
SHOPKEEP_MEET_ALT : Hello, shopkeeper. I want to do so many things, but the shop is a bit far away. Hmm! That's right. Our village is going through hard times and this time my telegram has gone missing. But don't worry! We still have a few stores! If the telegraph works properly again, we will have even more stores to shop.
DOCTOR_LIFEBLOOD_STATE_REPEAT : Oops! Come back! A giant rabbit heals the sick! There is no gain in pain. Use your comb and go! Don't worry, ma'am. I'm not losing heart.
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_FINISHED : Bam! A strong fighter, finally ready. This new sword shines from the claws of expert hands. Cutting back will be harder than ever. Mr. Ping, your efforts will be invaluable. We thank you.
COURIER_SHOP_MEET_ACT3 : Guardian! Terrible thing! The cave is shaking and with great pain from wounds. Now look at your poor servants. Your new friends hiding in this haunted house will have their hearts bursting with fear. And what are you doing here? Are you not helping us? We need porters! When darkness falls on the cave, porters are needed.
COURIER_SHOP_BROKEN : Quote! Panfilo, dusty! Unknown! Stop, postman! This is the hole! It's dangerous, my life is in danger. In that case, the packet rarely reaches its destination. Why don't you try again? For those who need immediate delivery?
BELLHERMIT_SAVED_2 : This creature also turns into a hot watch. Hmm. They deny that their duty is to serve strangers. Such a great and wonderful gift! Obviously this is a lie. Like the wise, they are weak, afraid to advance. This village was born out of laziness.
SHOPKEEP_MEET_ACCEPTEDWISH : I wish I could ask you that. If I ever have a question like this on my journey, I'd be happy to answer it.
PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_MEET_OFFER : Keys! A protector in a shell? You stand so calmly and patiently at the gate of Plinius' Clock Tower! What is the purpose of my role in saving your village? Your sword, mighty warrior! A sharp needle will show signs of lethal action. It came cursed to that place. A worm and a needle alone cannot save us. Impossible! But this sword, cleverly embedded in a nail, could do the job. Do you want to spare us? Blacksmith, your wisdom is appreciated and you are lucky to have saved the castle. This sword that builds your farm will already reap the fruits of your labor. Excellent! I was now busy clearing away the ruins of the needle, but by heroic and pitiful behavior she decided to tear me away from this one weapon.
RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW : And more! More memories from the past! Pictures, notes, statues! I will collect the history of the world and record it here!
COURIER_SHOP_REPEAT : Postman, there are still lots of files! When you're ready, help us!
PINSMITH_QUEST_UPGRADED : Prepare yourself! Pharaoh's miracle! See this magnificent sword. Who would have thought that the foundation of the country once shone so brightly? Who would have thought it would have lost so much...? This is a miracle, sir. My foundations haven't felt this strong in a long time. I don't remember such quality work. Go ahead! YES! Your sword is unique, exquisitely crafted, and sharper than any other sword. When a long journey brings you a dagger, touch me immediately! Who knows what I will find in your sharp weapon?
COURIER_SHOP_NOTACCEPTED_REPEAT : Well, marketers, I can't help you. My job is very interesting. Now is the time to do it! If the shipment doesn't arrive, the insect farmer will wake up sad!
PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_POST_SAVED : Sir Anders, how lucky you are to return! Come out here to the forest cemetery, cruel foes, stay. The bravest soldier, our hero, saved your life! The trip home was truly terrifying, now you are safe! And I'm so happy to see you again. The world is sinking into darkness! In these times, Lord Anders' duty is clear: to sharpen, polish and perfect the sword, so that the light may pierce the darkness.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_DUSTPENSSLAVE : I have ordered cotton eggs several times. A big, furry soul waits next to a cage full of cockroaches. I wish I was that lucky! I have met this beast before and I apologize for my cowardice. But it is useful for picking cotton. If my apples grow, I can earn money by delivering the queen fish. Mr. Shelder, is that a big, skinny thing? Do you like that? I think you have changed a lot...
COURIER_SHOP_FIRST_MEET_ACT3 : I helped the woman! I thought we were finally waiting, brothers and sisters, but something terrible has happened here too! The cave shakes and moans in pain. Below I see my poor new friends, weak at heart, in such delusions in the nest. But what are you doing? You didn't help us? We need news now more than ever! Unfortunately, we can't leave this orgy at home to keep our oysters alive. We are too far away. We have to be here. But instead we have all come up with a plan: how wonderful! Yes. Can strong people like you help us? For such a small reward? Our savings are gone and the cave is plunged into darkness. I have to get rid of the message. Now it's back!
RELIC_DEALER_MEET_ALT : What? what happened who are you what happened what do you want I've just been wandering around. By the way, what am I doing here? What should I do? This is the past! The voices of the past speak to me through what remains. These people, angry and crazy travelers, ring the bell. But you seem efficient and intelligent. If you find something old and beautiful, bring a story. I will accept it.
GREETER_HOUSE_MID_TALK : Pilgrims, your continued support of Belhart is commendable. In these troubled times, even the most unusual wish was granted. But only to accept gestures from strangers! Truly unheard of! Mr. Pabo, I saw you working in the flower shop. And I confess that even if this wish were granted, it would not mean much to ordinary people. Still, I was satisfied. Helping others... I had almost forgotten this little favor.
RELIC_DEALER_NO_RELICS : Preserving memories from the past is my passion. If you are interested, check out my collection! It is a must see!
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_BONETOWNFIXER_RETRY : We hope that all the supplies will reach the base camp, the starting point of the Hajj, without any problems!
COURIER_SHOP_INPROGRESS_2 : Mr. Courier, Happy Birthday! Send it! Don't wait any longer!
DOCTOR_CURSE_REPEAT : Come on! Follow the path through the desert to a mountain of twisted cells. Two bugs named Benzin and Kororo will collect what you need: lots of sharp, really sharp thorns!
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_4_POST : This sword! With claws! Finally ready! The master could have thought better. Clear, transparent. Bam! Peregrine, you have granted my wish and more. Your sword is wonderful, for it rivals the lords of old. Whether Faram is sick or plunged into this darkness, your spike will always shine.
RELIC_DEALER_DECLINE : What? Don't give up. How do you think this works?
GREETER_REPEAT_ACT3 : Be careful, Turks. Look at these poor insects and save their souls from suffering. Villagers, none of you will be able to break these walls. We take everything we can. Those who can be saved. Of course, it is better to live with insects.
PINSMITH_SAVED_REPEAT : Master Ping, be careful when you come back. Be careful if you see other insects on the way.
DOCTOR_SLAP_POST : Sorry! Explosion! The world has invaded me again! But the pain... Jarnavi won't help me! Nothing can stop my great work! Not much! I will not stop!
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_PAINT_NAME : Bell paint
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FIXER : Your new goal! And these things are necessary. Some of the survivors of the extinct camp lost their legs trying to feed themselves. Wounded and starving, few survived.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_GOURMAND : Home delivery - it's yours! Our restaurant prides itself on serving the freshest meat. Even the clerk knows it! Our restaurant's pastrami is delicious, salty and fatty, but it's time-sensitive. It spoils quickly if not stored immediately. If our pastrami looks like it's going bad, we take it right back. We don't want to waste your energy or our limited supplies.
FISHER_DLG_03 : Shelwood has become more dangerous lately, but I've always had a soft spot for sports. And I can't help it.
SHOP_ITEM_MULTIBIND : It is rare to find something this interesting on the market. It seems to enhance the natural healing powers of insects! I haven't seen any results, but on average I'm healthier.
RELIC_DEALER_MEET_ACT3 : Really? And more? What does that mean? Hello, madam, if you care about the destruction of this country, I am also to blame. Hmm. I have nothing to do with the problems and difficulties of foreigners! I have neither wisdom nor past shame! But you do. And you are a thorn in my side. If you find something good, old or historical, take it with you. I'll lift it up.
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_DECLINED : The choice is yours, warrior. If you choose a different path in the future, Freeny will be there to help.
GREETER_CURSED : Sick friend! Pabo, you are not well, but don't worry! Belhart is a place where travelers can rest and recuperate before continuing their journey. I appreciate your hospitality, Pabo, but I fear that rest alone can cure this disease. A parasite has taken up residence in my body and I cannot drive it out. Tell me, do you know someone who can help me? Doctor or doctor? are you safe Well... I was once very alone... Oh horrible demon! O cruel and savage character. For Belhart's sake, we have all decided to exile him. I don't know where he goes, but I want to leave him alone! But if you find him, a good start would be to contact the elders hidden under Belhart. Yes... This hermit may seem foolish, but let him know that he is gaining wisdom. Maybe he'll tell you where the poor doctor is hiding.
GREETER_HOUSE_FULL_REPEAT : Tourist, you are in luck! Bell Hart always greets you with your big, sharp knives.
GREETER_TALK_1 : Turkey, do you remember how you ended up in this story? Oh my god, it's so indirect... Just thinking about it makes me lose my balance. Strange, sad memories, other people's memories and my own thoughts are crushed under this tangle. If someone could be involved in something bigger that would be truly wonderful. But now it totally scares me.
SPINNER_INTRO : Ah! Ah! Now they are one... united by Huey's peace, serving the world. What is Huey's role in Greatest Pain?
COURIER_SHOP_FIRSTDELIVERY : But wait, here's the news! Read all messages carefully before sending! Do not shake them or use them in a new way! Use your claws, nails and wings to guide you to your destination. Mr. Message, please direct your message carefully. Treat it like you treat it.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_FLEATOPIA_RETRY : Thanks to the smart chip, all products are packed fresh. Send us a message. Maybe we have found a new friend thanks to your service? We are right.
DOCTOR_CLOSED : Oops! Who's winning this time? Release this giant rabbit! Throw him out!
DOCTOR_CLOSED_CURSED : Ma'am, I'm about to faint. We desperately need your protection. I have become an evil parasite. He wants to use my strength to break through my shell.
DOCTOR_CONVO_1 : You are all idiots! Oh, what a great achievement! My miracle machine has cured all this virus! If even a few caterpillars die, everyone goes crazy. Is there no room for progress in your dark mind?
FISHER_DLG_02 : Although Belhart has lost his light, we can still offer some comfort to the pilgrims who ascend this hill.
GREETER_MEET_ACT3 : My dear neighbor, it is like a ray of sunshine to see you alive in a place where darkness has fallen upon us all. So many strangers have come... I never thought so many would survive. Mahemius signaled the coming evil by ringing a bell. Of course! It could have been worse! If it hadn't been for your friend, the warrior with the shining ring, who so skillfully chose our village as his camp, things would have been even worse. This mighty serpent now protects our fortress and the strangers who flock there. Thanks to his work, our shells are safe, but I don't know how long he can do this task.
COURIER_SHORT_QUEST_AVAILABLE : My brother's papers are still there somewhere. I'm sure others will find it useful. I just want them to be safe. But I don't have the courage. It's been too long! I hope my brother will return to the wall and that this precious document is safe. Look at the wall and show it to him. If your will pleases me, perhaps you will too.
SHOPKEEP_MEET_EXPANDED_ALT : Hello shop owner. Your shop looks surprisingly clean, considering all the work you've put into it. Well, we've been through a lot! Even the once worn Belhart is now rare. But life is better, Freyja! Hey, it's true! At least the city has been pacified and my messenger is back with a new fruit. Whether you are a tourist or a traveler, this is the best shop to visit in this desert.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_SPA_NAME : personal spa
SHOPKEEP_SAVED_COURIER_1 : Shop owner, thanks for stopping by. Stock is back in stock. The messenger seems to have arrived safe and sound. Yes, the little guy finally came to collect your bags. How cute! He was very upset by this unfortunate incident and found it difficult to convince him. But he's finally here! Don't forget to check out our new products!
SPINNER_INTRO_2 : Ah! Here she is! A special boy! Beloved daughter of the worm and the weaver. The daughter of those who tried to escape fell. Finally she found her home, the weapons, the silk, the beautiful nails and her mother...
SHOPKEEP_FURNISHING : Thank you for a great shopping experience! Please bear with us, we look forward to welcoming Mason Bell.
RELIC_DEALER_CYLINDER : Ah! what do you have A book from the sacred chest of the palace! It contains a lot of discovery. Do you want to give it? I don't want to communicate with anyone; I am a seeker. You need a listening device to extract the information hidden in this cylinder, which you don't have. If you give it, it will be hidden forever. Hmm... If you don't tell me, it won't do you any good! Don't bother me unless you find something interesting!
COURIER_SHOP_BROKEN_SHORT : Is your message tired and worn out? Do you want to try again, message? The flower bugs need your help!
PINSMITH_QUEST_CANCOMPLETE_REOFFER : It's going to be a blast! You have the oil! Will it work wonders with your sword?
GREETER_MEET_ALT : Hail, weary pilgrims! The great Belhart was long gone, but he was still the last before the castle. My Pabo, it is my duty to welcome strangers like you. Come on! I hope you are well, with the hospitality that applies even in the midst of "poverty". We have products and services for you! Despite the limitations of this sandy land, it is certainly a welcome stop.
PINSMITH_QUEST_DECLINE : Sure, right? This is definitely the safest option. It is best to leave the shell as it is.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_PILGRIMSREST_RETRY : I used to give parking in town. I did the same when I was young and strong.
COURIER_SHORT_REPEAT : This city seems safe, but worry about the rest of us. Do couples need a good supply? We have killed a lot of bugs thanks to our warden and me and my brother have given him pills. This is especially important when the stakes are high.
SHOPKEEP_TAKEN_COURIER_1 : Absolutely! You crossed my wish off the list! I'm looking for Mia's messenger. I have a shop and a lot to do. If I see any mistakes Mia makes on my travels, I'll let you know. Thanks! Very few insects know how to help their friends.
SHOP_ITEM_SPOOL_SEGMENT_DESC : The silk is surprisingly heavy but inexplicable. Or maybe it's the vine from the old gift?
GREETER_CURSED_REPEAT : If you're looking for this busy doctor, talk to the old hermit hiding outside Belhart. He knows more about the world than he is letting on.
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_3_POST : I did it! It is a miracle that iron can be broken. There are only a few needles left in Paruma! Tell me, traveler, where did you find such a magnificent weapon? This is the noble sword of our nation. They made the hardest iron but were rarely seen outside their caves. This family disappeared long ago, and with them the secrets of this art. Ah, even if they have disappeared, it is still incomprehensible! But how lucky that simple pillow was to have such a weapon!
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_GRAMAPHONE_NAME : Gramophone
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_SONGCLAVE_RETRY : Good news for the pilgrims in Ramat! The brave men who have made this great castle their home are in dire need of this package, my friend. Bring it to us safe and sound!
DOCTOR_CURSE_FIX_DECLINE : Long live! You are unsure! But your fear of your savior is pure ignorance. You can win if you try. Wait a moment and think again!
DOCTOR_CURSE_REOFFER : Great Yarnwy can remove the "root" of the problem, but you need to trigger the trigger to break through the sticky shell.
SHOPKEEP_GENERIC : Hi! Can you get me something special before I start work?
COURIER_SHOP_MENTION_GOURMAND : Transportation, I need meat soup with old insects for the palace. Do you know how to cook? Insects? Do you know what our best food is? If you don't mind, I will do it right now! Postman, please.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_DESK_DESC : A desk is the solid foundation of any home office! It keeps everything organized and contains all the essentials.
DOCTOR_CURSE_FIX_REOFFER : I don't know if the root is bothering you, but that's ok! If you still need to remove something, use the Yanbei Extractor! That's your only hope!
DOCTOR_CURSE_DECLINE : Speaking of asking for help, don't you want to help yourself? Come on! Stop bothering me, stop bothering me, friend!
SHOPKEEP_GENERIC_ACT3 : my loves, the world falls and falls, but as long as my building is strong, my shop will be open.
PINSMITH_QUEST_COMPLETE_REFUSE : Really? Are you collecting precious oil? Why were you wearing high heels? Are you denying it? I can only afford such beautiful clothes!
RELIC_DEALER_REMEET_ACT3 : What? Not anymore? What is everyone clamoring for? Hello, ma'am, it's me. If this country collapses and becomes dire, it will probably be my fault. Uncomfortable? Hmm. Anyone can criticize posterity. Now my collection is complete! I'll defend it!
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_MASKMAKER : Birth is deadly, dangerous, scary and cold. It is very important for the trader! Everything he has done is good and we forgive him. Messenger Sahib, this will be your judgment! IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU. Molding paint is long and hard work. Even with big hands it is difficult. I have already met this teacher. He is worthy of the honor of a long life. Help him in his work.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_PILGRIMSREST : We are taking care of a small parking lot in a field next to the farm that is still being worked on. Transporter, is the journey too tiring for you? Your wish will surely come true!
GREETER_REPEAT : Hello tourists! Recharge your tired body and weak mind! Belhart! Spectacular, magical and completely safe! Be patient for the final climb!
DOCTOR_MAGGOT_REPEAT : Rest in peace! Dad! Leave my little sickness and leave me alone! A big rabbit doesn't worry about small ailments! I understand, ma'am. I'm not losing heart.
SHOPKEEP_MEET_EXPANDED : Hello, shopkeeper. It looks like you pulled it from the cotton. Absolutely! I am a clever worm. The loose thread is firmly attached to the bell pocket. I would be a nuisance to those around me, but my shop is full of goods, so there is no need to worry about hunger. Like your car it was a success and I still have plenty of it. And yes, the salesman is back at work selling me the goods!
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_4_PRE_REOFFER : Come on, tourists! We have oil! Shine like never before!
RELIC_DEALER_ASK_PROMPT_PLURAL : can you tell me
DOCTOR_CONVO_2 : But wait! There is something inside. Simple, gray interior! How angry you are! But your heart aches! What is inside your shell that your fine, subtle senses cannot perceive? Shall I show you an example? Quick! The great Jernavi will reveal your deepest, deepest secrets! Doctor, I don't want to see your purple again. Your service is crowned with success and paid for by pain. I hope I never ask for your help again.
PINSMITH_FURTHER_REPEAT : When you finally find the oil after a long journey, help me! No one knows what secrets lie beneath the edge of your sword!
DOCTOR_CLOSED_ACT3 : Oh my god! Who is making all this noise? All this thrilling and screaming! Something important must be going down! Oops!
DOCTOR_CURSE_ENDED : Operation... succeeded! The fools hiding in that stupid clock tower would tremble and fall if they knew what I would have done without them! Woman... I won't lie, this rarely happens to me, yet it seems the parasite... has been released. The shell that has calmed down inside has enough power against us. Maybe it's just a coincidence. Absolutely, absolutely! The great Yanbi has healed you! Cry from the caves, cry from this great tower. Let your voice be heard in the so-called "civilized" villages of this ignorant country!
RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW_COMPLETE_REPEAT : Great summary of the previous one. Too bad the whole story isn't included!
SHOPKEEP_MEET_ACT3 : Cry, come back! The world may tremble, rot, and be on the brink of destruction, but as long as the shell remains intact, my shop will be open.
DOCTOR_CURSE_FIX_ACCEPT : We did it! We did it! Sorry! We finally found an example that we could use to our advantage! Our righteous Savior has been wronged! I came, what...!
PINSMITH_BELLTOWN_MEET_OFFER_ALT : Keys! Who is this brave warrior standing so calmly at the door of Pliny's bell tower? Being a woman, the sword will benefit from your indulgence. Your sword! A strong warrior! The groomer will see the fatal mark in this seam. If your weapon is wielded and the kingdom is merciful within the kingdom, swear on your honor and deliver it to me at once! Do you want to see it?
DOCTOR_CLOSED_QUEST : If you don't come back with a tip, don't come! Your time is valuable, Mr. Jarnawi! I will not stop you from doing your job!
PINSMITH_SAVED_TALK : Ah... how it would hurt if lost strangers threw me into the grave and we slept forever while the world was falling apart! My God! Maybe this pin-up artist needs a little more practice. Only in uncertain times!
BELLHERMIT_CURSED : What is this shame within you? A slave is a slave inside! Crush the shell and expand something? There is a parasite breeding within me. I can't eat my energy and it's not just disgusting... it's disgusting. Because I don't want to die. Let's give this beautiful creature plenty of life. Fife. Find Yanbei's daughter, who was exiled from Belhart. I know she is far away, somewhere in the desert.
RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW_FIRST : And so much more! Collect even more from the past! Pictures, notes, statues! I will collect the history of the world and record it here! If there are real relics from the last century, we must find them. Until then, it's time to worry.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_MASKMAKER_RETRY : Thanks, Mr. Messenger! I will get back to you with the content. Don't worry, there's plenty of content out there. Climbing Frosty Peak is a real challenge! Thanks for your interest!
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_GOURMAND_RETRY : Messenger, bring the food quickly! Hurry up! If pastrami is not processed, the flavor will quickly fade.
DOCTOR_CLOSED_REPEAT : Throw them away! Unless they contain something dangerous or valuable. Otherwise, leave Jurnawi!
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_PAINT_DESC : The hat is in good condition. Some surfaces show signs of wear, but why not refurbish it? A coat of protective varnish and a few touch ups will make it shine even more!
FISHER_DLG_MEET : You seem too harsh, friend. Are you a hunter? Oh, simple people. I fished in the pond next door. It's a matter of survival! Bellharts and I love fresh food, so this oyster catch makes a great gift. At least there are still plenty of good fish in Lake Shelwood, especially if your oyster storage is what I'm after.
BELLHERMIT_SNARE_REPEAT : The duties of our servants are confirmed. No more words are needed. The Internet is spreading. Come, let the restless republic burn.
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_3_PRE : Master Ping, I have the oil for that. It wasn't an easy choice, but if the sword helps, it's worth it. And the oil? What a blessing! Oh, wonderful gift, amazing quantity and one beast. Madam, for your service, will you give me oil and perhaps a rosary? Master Ping, would you forgive me if I didn't want to do another miracle with steel?
SHOP_ITEM_CRESTSOCKET_BELLHART : It's amazing, full of precious memories. This is my fondest memory, but I'm sure it will be useful to you too.
DOCTOR_SLAP_INTRO : Don't be silly, set a good example! Participant. You will understand better! You will learn! Is there any hope to save this desolate and sterile world? No, cockroaches blink. What you seek will not be found in my shell nor in this one.
GREETER_HOUSE_FULL_TALK : Mr. Traveler, thanks to your hard work, our village is shining again. The houses are being built and the streets are sparkling! Mr. Indik, I have noticed a change in myself. I'm glad my contribution was not in vain. There you go! Your generosity is extraordinary! In a minute... we're in desperate need of insects! What would a village be without its inhabitants? Old age, lack of food, the death of children from diseases... Bella's heart is plagued by countless diseases. Now there are only us she met left. To honor her noble commitment and take steps to solve the problem, we have ordered a wonderful gift! A truly unique clock tower! A place where she can realize her ideas. Rest on the bed. It hovers above us, next to the beloved battle of Pong. Indik, I am not going to sit down, but in the meantime my mission in Faroma continues. In the meantime, you have to experience the place. Absolutely! Absolutely! Her wonderful spirit inspires us all! Even when challenges come, you will always be strong with a warrior by your side!
DOCTOR_REPEAT : If you don't want to reveal your secret to me, don't bother me anymore. Oops! I still have a long way to go, great creator! Think and learn! Even if the unknown world tries to escape me, I will save it with claws!
PINSMITH_SAVED_THANK_1 : Hi! I saved the most adorable prince from a really scary situation! I am so happy to finally see these beautiful evergreen trees dancing and singing!
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_4_PRE : Master Ping, I don't want to hear any more about your power. I have brought you another string. Too fat! This worm is amazing! It's time to perfect your sword! Acquire unique abilities! Come, come! Tourist, what are you waiting for? Are you ready to start?
PINSMITH_SAVED_THANK_2 : Master Ping, this path is dangerous. Especially now that the Black Thread is crossing the country. Your only chance to survive is with your friends in Bloharter. They can protect each other and maybe restore everything in a short time. Of course they can! Prinny didn't want to leave her best friend Belle, but now that the world is headed for destruction, Maltra must say goodbye to her beloved forever. But of course it has to be repeated. Master Ping, this city needs great things more than ever!
RELIC_DEALER_POSTWINDOW_COMPLETE : Yes... Yes. This is truly a wonderful collection! I have collected so many! No disrespect! If you like this collection, I would appreciate your help in updating it. Hmm! What do you have to be thankful for? I'll show you my collection. You will be innocent enough!
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_BONETOWNFIXER : Previously, an expedition was conducted due to the discovery of bones and insects in the camp. Even today, these materials are hard to find. The camp is located at the foot of the mountain, a destination for many pilgrims. These materials will be invaluable in preparing for the ascension of Jesus Christ.
PINSMITH_UPGRADE_3_PRE_REOFFER : Oh wayfarers, can you perhaps give them oil and pearls for their toil? Do you want this sharp sword to perform another miracle?

Our goal, dear Turks, is to revive people like your faithful. Wow, your village seems to be coming back to life! I was a little worried that you would become a shell after freedom. Many people are not well off... most villagers are not so well off. We build, grow and welcome you! On a mission for Belhart.
FISHER_DLG_01 : Have you heard of Fry? Travelers always have helpful articles like this one.
SHOPKEEP_PAINT_PRE : Complete, optional! Here is your beautiful maid. Get started now!
GREETER_FURNISHINGS : If you feel a little lonely in the Ballhouse, talk to Frey. He is known for his diverse collection of furniture. While its contents are not very useful to outsiders, it is perfect for those new to the Bellhouse.
COURIER_SHOP_BEGIN_SONGCLAVE : Up there, in the huge castle, a new place appeared. Of course they say it's safe! They need our help too! This castle... I know the truth! It's not as peaceful as outsiders say! Even though the strong have given in, the danger remains! They need food, care, protection. But bring a message!

DOCTOR_MAGGOT : Woman, I'm sick. Disgusting insects crawl around me in the desert swamp. In short, I want to be free of insects. Insects! Are there that many, Jarnawi? My time is precious! I am seriously ill! Why is everything weak? Bench, bed, stone; I just need a rest. Sit somewhere. The insects will appear suddenly and unexpectedly.
SHOPKEEP_GENERIC_HOUSE : Hello, my friend! How about a joke before we go?
SHOPKEEP_MEET : Hello shop owner. It seems that the bombyx dose is in high demand. I am! What a cunning worm I am! When a strange thread fell from the sky, I was locked and hidden in Bell Heart. I would be a burden to everyone here, but my camp is full of supplies, so don't worry, I won't starve. Your preparation worked. The street shop is now in ruins. That's how it is. I have to admit that the wait was longer than expected. I eat worms... bring more when news comes. Ever since the curse fell upon us, he has had to stay away from Bell Heart.
SHOP_ITEM_FURNISHING_LIGHTS_NAME : Image description
BELLHERMIT_ENSLAVED_1 : Are you still angry? Come on, mate! I told you so! Do you know what happened to those insects over there? They hang in a big net. Hmm, I'm not surprised. I know that all fortunes depend on the people on stage. Find it first. Do you think your destiny is different? Hunger, fear and pride are all that fill this fragile heart. You are also sentenced to prison! Guns! Come on, mate! They think their opponents have turned out to be fools.
BELLHERMIT_ENSLAVED_2 : Do you want to cut them? Hmm, that sounds very dangerous. If the umbilical cord is cut, they go back to being patients. They will remember their fears and desires. What a spectacle! Are you just empowering yourself?
PINSMITH_QUEST_CANCOMPLETE : Mr. Simsa, I have needle sharpening oil. My God! What's so weird? what do i want To steal such a beautiful gift. How many Sims this age have had similar experiences?
