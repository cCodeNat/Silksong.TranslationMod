MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_04 : Te-Wei saw the insects sitting on the dragons' heads, not thinking about their meaning. Ah. But isn't that always the case for those who enter the depths of Tu-Wei's servitude? He was booked once for rioting, albeit in the second half. We were dependent on the will of the weavers. But the palace, although it has lost its purpose, I still know its role intuitively. It is both a church and a barn. Ah. The elders of Vos-Wei were worshiped by this demon and his evil, cunning spirits. This arrangement, or muscipula, as they call it, is a way to lock the mother in their dreams and keep them happy in her false dominion.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_DELIVERY : I present to you the author of Belhart. I bow to you with gratitude for your long service. Hey, old man, you know you were wrong. Such men often serve us like deadly insects. I am not like you, creator. I have seen enough pain caused by their control. If I could, I would go.
MASK_MAKER_REPEAT1_ACT3 : You make me a mask until the cave collapses!
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT_ACT3 : That is to say. My contract is still valid. I will work until the cave collapses. My God, if I could, I would save my country.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET : Oh, old man! You know how rude it is to expose yourself like that. Removing my mask only complicates matters. You may protest, Creator, I dare to listen to your clear words. Ah. Your arrival is not so surprising. We have felt the vibrations of the monarchy, the vibrations of its family, from this place to the corner. Do you want to contradict me? Do you want to pass? Are we perhaps wounded, great gods? Our relationship seems inevitable, but first we need strength to maintain the desired results. Ah! As expected! The ancient nations did not want a peaceful condemnation. But if you win, I ask you to continue your work. Whatever the situation in these areas, you will understand the need for my services.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_PREVIOUSLY_MET_ACT3 : Have you returned, or is it already in the past? The consequences of the marriage contract with the blue and white mother... are being guarded. The fate of this cave is dire. Can we say that the situation is getting more complicated? Or is this perhaps the desired outcome? Our meeting was disastrous, but the last, desperate words of the prince threaten the fall of the whole kingdom. Ah! I'm not surprised! Isn't it always like this? As ancestral races vie for supremacy, deadly insects are thrust into a race without a trace. O Creator, I prayed for freedom. I don't know how the world is, but I didn't want this weird thing.
MASK_MAKER_REPEAT1 : Everyone should have a face. Maybe just one! Before we die, let's give the faceless a chance.
MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2_ACT3 : An instant is a matter of life and death. It should be very interesting.
MASK_MAKER_DELIVERY : The author of Belhart, who I have consulted for a long time. Excellent! Excellent! The light seal to keep the face of the town fresh.
MASK_MAKER_POST : Dear customers, give us a gift for your service! You can give us a gift or take home a souvenir!
MASK_MAKER_MEET : Wow! Excellent! But he already has a mask. He even has a face. For those who don't have, I have to cut it off.
MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3 : Let's get started! Let's get started! We need to open the hood.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_PEAK : Did you bring the creature down from the peak? Your ancestors liked the company so much that they built a hut and a lighthouse on this dangerous peak. I was honored and you earned the favor. Feathers now cover the cloak and protect these roads from the cold. It is a priceless gift to give yourself something so precious... It seems that it entrusted its destiny to you. It could not foresee our hostility towards the king, but it sensed the seriousness of the matter and the still greater changes that awaited us.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET_ACT3 : Ah! Old man! People, as you know, are inhumane to expose me to this. Exposing yourself makes the job a little more difficult. Despite your protests, Creator, I hear your thoughts. Ah. Well, I'm not surprised you came. I sensed and felt the results of your battle with the reassuring blue mother. The fate of this cave seems complicated. Do you think it's headed in an even more complicated direction? Is this the desired result? Our plan proved fatal, but the prince's final words now threaten to destroy the entire kingdom. Haha! I'm not surprised! Do you always enjoy it? As the ancient race fights for power, invisible, deadly snakes are taking over. Creator, this was freedom for me and the common people. I don't know, hey, but I didn't mean for it to be this weird.
MASK_MAKER_MEET_ACT3 : Easy! It's too late! It is a person. It's a face. I have eliminated the faceless ones.
MASK_MAKER_POST_UNMASK : "Please, old man, reward me for my work. It's not easy to transport such an expensive vehicle safely, especially one of this size."
MASK_MAKER_RELATIONSHIP : Your face is so beautiful. It is not my work. It is not the work of artists of this kingdom. At least not yet. But there is something deeper. Long relationship. Something like the old servant Parm. Go ahead! The deal is done. It's a deal! I want a mask.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_03 : Creator of the world, you have proof. Tell me what you see. Your personality... Ancient, quite clear. Attention, hunter or guide. I can ignore that title, even though it's a complicated concept, but I still have a question. When I saw this, I understood. My person had held its unique form for days. Ah, powerful indeed, but your species seldom grows steadily, and the life of a worm is not suited to one like you. Maybe you will grow old...
MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3_ACT3 : The whole world is talking about the end of the world! But they continue to sew masks.
MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT : Enough, enough. I am so busy with work that I don't even have time to rest. God this is rude.
MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2 : Do what you have to to survive. A serious gift.
