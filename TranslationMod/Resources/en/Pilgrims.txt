GATE_PILGRIM_REMEET_NO_SHRINES : Sister, the castle is calling us! We have arrived. Only the prayer of this bell will open the gate. Come in, I'm calling you. I hope we don't have to wait long.
GATE_PILGRIM_REPEAT_NO_SHRINES : Only a holy bell on the road will open our way! Travelers, wait for the call. Only then can we overcome this last season.
GATE_PILGRIM_REMEET_GOT_SHRINES : On...on! The bells have rung! In every street. Now we can only hear their melodies through music! I recently started making silk drums. I truly believe it is an art worth practicing. Ah! Ah! Brother, don't lose your temper! Play with all your heart. All music is beautiful! If you play for us, the bells will surely ring! Let's dance and sing!
GATE_PILGRIM_REMEET_SHRINES : Ah... the door! The bell rang! Please, sister. If you ring a bell or bell we will follow you. If you ring the bell, the door is open!
GATE_PILGRIM_REPEAT_SHRINES : Please, sister! Do not delay! Call us. Open the door and look!
GATE_PILGRIM_MEET : The door... the door! Ah, the castle gate is for us! There it is! May the great men open the way behind the door and lead poor strangers like us to the light. I also look inside the castle. Do you know how to open this door? Ah... no weapon can stop him. He is not tall. They say the sound of the bell! The sacred bell on the road opens the way!
GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_NO_SHRINES : Haji, I have passed by this clock many times. I see it resonates. Tell me, what do you know about this place? Let's find a bell that hasn't rung yet. Brother? Do me a favor! This would make a wonderful gift for a friend. We want to tell him about this church and place we have heard about.
GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_ALT : The door... the door! Ah, the palace gate is for us! There it is! The great men who sit behind the door can open a way for us and lead us, poor as we are, to the light. Do you know the way? Ah... no weapon can stop it. No lock. It's called a bell! The sacred bell opens our way!
GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_SHRINES : As we went deeper, we saw many large clocks placed in ancient sacred places. Everyone was calling for them to wake us up, but the gates remained closed. What else can we do to move forward? Ring the bells? Now we walk in these holy lands. The last step is easy! Wonderful, authentic music. We see that the music is in tune with the bells and the gates. Pastor, you will be the guide! You are the bearer of this blessing! We call you or sing and follow you.
