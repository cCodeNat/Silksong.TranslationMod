TROUPE_LEADER_DECLINE_QUEST1 : Wow... I see. It is very difficult for a human, let alone a mosquito, to make a decision. I heard they wanted to build a wall in the village below. Perhaps we should send Grishkin to grant our wishes?
TROUPE_HUNTER_EMPTY : Bugs, fleas, my theory is written on your paper. We never met again. Come on! Let's find and save the lost fleas. 10,000 sixes to the village!
TROUPE_LEADER_INFO_HUNTER : do you know him Our new friend, my goodness! We are back after a long search. We could catch fleas. It's amazing to have such a powerful mosquito. Your RV has a serious defense problem, but I'm cautious and can't defend you. He is not strong! So don't worry! His smell is very strong, his behavior is unique, but his abilities are highly developed. Even if a predator is approaching, he keeps company in silence.
TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET_NOMAP_ACT3 : Do you want to be a worm or not a mosquito? Do you want to work with me? I have a lot of knowledge. I have met and smelled the lost in every cave. You can find them! And bring them back! It's the Middle Ages, we are one... but you don't have a map! If you want to learn, you will find a map. As yet there is no room for conversation.
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ACT3 : The end of our journey is approaching and the end of the world is approaching! In these difficult times, a drink with friends can be a joy.
CARAVAN_LECH_INTRO : See you soon, Mr. Flea. You are safe in this van. Hey, that's right! Thank you all! Oh, my! Hey hey hey! Boring, talkative flea calls me Miss Wasp, but such a spicy name is no match for this subtle beauty! Want a pretty name like "Sweet Nectar"? No, no. Call me by name, call me Gradak! Absolutely! Absolutely! Hey hey hey! Now tell me my secret. My van is being turned into a spa. This is truly an extraordinary gift. The hot water inside is hotter and cleaner than any hymn! Hey hey hey! May you be lucky enough to sleep in there for a small fee!
FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_FIRST : Alas, while poor Kelti was still alive! But I'm glad you did! Why don't you play again? Enjoy the beauty of agility while you await death. The game is simple: jump and run as far as you can, avoid the insects!
TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_REPEAT_GREYMOOR : Magnificent gray animals roam the lands. Their screams and cries can be heard even outside the camp. It's best to stay home and keep quiet.
FG_DODGE_CHOICE : Developer with fleas?
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_FLEATOPIA : We did not go beyond the walls! Sand, bugs... it was worth bringing it all back! It's time to relax and celebrate. No one deserves you, Miss Hornet! Grab a bottle and a toast with us!
TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_REPEAT : We will stay in this gray land until Chip turns six. If you find a lost friend, don't forget to help!
TROUPE_LEADER_ACCEPT_QUEST_OUTRO : I run through these areas and help the fleas get to their destination. But if I come across a flea on the way, I will help her with all my might. Oh, I need nothing more! They are all hidden in hostile areas or lying in wait. But if you feed them, they will come here. God bless your journey and keep you, traveler! Rest here as the path leads you!
TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_MEET_TRAVELED : It's been a long journey but we haven't found a single flea! I am glad to hear that the guests you invite will bring you good luck! Was it a fun trip? Was it friendly? We spent it with wonderful children... They are indeed good people. It is not uncommon to meet such lively friends. Be brave! Now let's go to Grishkin's house. He is sitting over a boiling pot. Let's eat something and refresh ourselves after a long journey!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_BREW_FULL : Mr. Hornet, we'll give you a bottle of beer. And if you don't drink? Ha ha ha! If you do, come back and I'll refill your bottle! I always love beer!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT : My friends are worried about the remaining fleas, but I don't care. We have to ask, otherwise who cares? Hahaha!
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_REWARD : "Oh, before you disappear and leave us again, I have a little present for you! The children dug in the sand and found something blue and white. The ridge is great. I don't think it's good for our fleas, so of course everyone is happy and wants to give the loot to their friend."
TROUPE_LEADER_DELIVERY_FLEATOPIA_POST : Consider this simple ray the reward of your labor and eternal friendship. If you're lucky, you might replace it with our insect balls!
CARAVAN_LECH_TALK_ACT3 : My love, you are the only light in the darkness! Don't you want to warm your torch in the light of Clata and wash away all your troubles?
CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_ACCEPT_2 : Come in! I see it floating... right here!
TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_MEET_GREYMOOR : Dodson. Want to get out of this heavy, gray air? It is heavy and moist. I am worried about the fleas in this country. They play happily in the dirty water. They laugh and throw me out. What a shame! Most insects naturally follow people who have strength and courage. Governments ignore unless told. Hmm... is that what the flea trap teaches? I decided to rest here until the time comes.
FG_DODGE_DECLINE : Come on, little bug, get out of here! We await the enemy.
FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED : Viconia! It's our game. But maybe after a little break we can play together again?
FESTIVAL_BOARD_TITLE_JUGGLE : magic
TROUPE_LEADER_ACCEPT_QUEST1 : Hi! Hi, did I do it right? Can you ride me for sex? Is that fair?
TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_FLEATOPIA : "Miss Wasp! Guardian! I have been waiting for your arrival! And here you are! You are a wonderful place, you have given us peace from the darkness and death around. It is here that wise and powerful fleas thrive. Our journey ends here. No colony is more beautiful than Parma. Mr. Flea, I'm so glad you found this site. It is comforting to know that so many fleas are able to survive. It seems that many dominant creatures have sadder fates. Truly! Bright descendants await us! It is both for you and your work. Join us in celebrating my passing.

Knowing that I must sew and collect these fleas with me. I've also added a tool bag to make my travels easier. This is a small favor, much less than you deserve, but I hope you enjoy it."
TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_REFUSE : Master Free, I don't know what you are doing. I just can't participate. Ha, ha, ha! Everything, everything is wrong! How can we start without you, dear best friend?
FESTIVAL_OUTRO_SCENE : We are gathered here for the final challenge of the entire festival, in honor of the supreme champion of them all! Now, Miss Hornet! Defeat this monstrous statue with all your might.
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA : Only fleas have fun here. This is the most satisfying sound you've ever heard!
TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_INTRO_FULL_EARLY : Ah, my Missa Hornet, see this wonderful place! So many people here! But the air is wonderful. All this is due to heroic efforts!
FG_BOUNCE_CHOICE : Are you participating in a free dance competition?
TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_JUDGE_TRAVELED : A new journey is at an end! And near this palace a new tomb appeared! Fortunately, all my friends are safe. Nearby, slopes and dense forest have harbored countless insects. This climb was truly dangerous! Was it you, Miss Hornet, who showed them fortune? With you and your weapons, even the mosquitoes are safe.
TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_INTRO_ALT : "Oh, Mr. Bumblebee, look! There are so many fleas wandering around here! Looks like the last dying fleas have joined us."
TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_1 : Ah! Ah! The transparent cover is ready! Fear not, my friend. We are humble mosquito tourists! It is a pleasure to meet you. I love you, I'm not of this world. I am only showing you the way. Ah! My travel companion! For the traveler who finds himself on an unknown road, it is true.
CARAVAN_LECH_TALK : Dodson, my Dodson! Hey, hey, hey! Are you wearing a gorgeous dress with jewels? i adored you...
FG_JUGGLE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE : Viconia! Let the game begin! The trick master has conquered the bay! Dear fleas, praise the strength of the beautiful Miss Vespa!
TROUPE_LEADER_INCOMPLETE_QUEST1 : Many fleas are scattered around the kingdom, waiting, alone. He can continue his journey by train. These beautiful fleas love to explore, explore and play, so you'll find them in the most unexpected places. But when you wake up, you will definitely find yourself here!
TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_FLEATOPIA_REPEAT_ACT3 : A commotion from the underworld sounds like the roar of a wild beast. But I think this fight is more tragic. Fleas and monsters have their problems.
HORNET_FLEA_LAKE_FOUND : Azad Sardar and his companions were looking for a large, safe cave. This peaceful lake and its beaches were perfect for them.
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_READYTOLEAVE : Ah, Miss Bumblebee! How our company has grown! How strong and powerful it is! We can't all fit in this golden room! Many mosquitoes die after flying back into the air in search of a place to spread their wings. But I hesitate to order them right away. These peaks are too dangerous to go without shelter and safety. And you, Miss Bumblebee? You came into the world with a mission. Have you found the right place?
TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_GENERIC : Before we continue, let's calm down. These rare moments of safety and peace are precious.
TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_INTRO : "Ah, Miss Hornet, look! What fleas are roaming about! It seems even the recently dead have joined us."
TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_2 : See you soon and remember I'm the leader of this company, Flea! Our journey has not started yet, but come, we can stop here for a while. A dark and winding road, where you will meet some beautiful creatures!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_JUDGE : The swamp was full of dangers. He climbed back up and it looked like the handsome assassin had fallen into the clutches of a hungry insect! Unfortunately, he eventually succeeded. In the face! Jokes aside, Grishkin and Belga are like fleas.
BREW_REFILL_PROMPT : Want to sweeten your pea drink?
TROUPE_HUNTER_ALL_FLEAS_FOUND : You have it! Lice are not fleas. I'm dead! There is a purpose. Full trailer! Now my mission has changed. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I love this new job.
TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_RETURN : Is it really hot here? It's amazing... how can I put it? Is it beautiful? But I still enjoy fighting fleas. It's like we've been transported to a more dangerous place.
CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_DECLINE : Oh... what a shame! Oh, oh, oh! Think about it, the hot water inside is amazing!
TROUPE_LEADER_DELIVERY_FLEATOPIA : A message from Bellhart, Lord Flea has brought supplies for your colony. Mr. Hornet, continue your mission! The place seems safe and harmless, but the nutrients are insufficient and countless insects need special care! The food and supplies you bring are vital in these difficult conditions.
FG_DODGE_INTRO_REPEAT : Not all fleas are created equal in this challenge. Stay on the field and avoid their attacks. The longer you hold out, the higher your score will be.
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET : Uncle, uncle! Welcome to our van! You are such a funny, strange flea. You don't even have hair and you're losing it! Ha ha ha! Just kidding. Fleas are known for pranks!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_RETURN : The ground is full of bones and the animals eat so much that it is difficult to ride. What a challenge! Bones are scattered everywhere! I wish I had a chair like that, haha!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_FESTIVAL : Drink, Mr. Wasp! Don't waste it! Let's play to the bay before it comes out!
FG_DODGE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE : The exams are over and you have earned your past grades. Rishikesh, Guruji!
TROUPE_LEADER_OFFER_QUEST1_REPEAT : I don't usually talk to my guests about business problems. But! Isn't it wiser in this world to express our deepest desires to strangers? I also wish the poor lost fleas would come back to us! What should I do?
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_CANLEAVE : Flea, if your group still likes to travel, at the end of the ancient aqueduct we found a cave on the shore of the castle. It could well have hidden it. It's a long way, but when you get there, you'll find a wide, clear lake with a sandy beach untouched by seals. The most peaceful place you have ever seen in this dangerous land. There it is! There it is! We have finally arrived at our destination. The journey continues! Mr. Bumblebee, you are Flea's loyal friend. The place welcomes us. Will you join us on this new journey?
CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_INTIMIDATED_ACT3 : Dear customer... You are done now, don't you need Rosario? Try Sparker for free! Dear Kelti, we would be happy to help!
TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA : Many doubts have led me here. But maybe there are more in this world.
CARAVAN_LECH_WOUNDED_TALK : Aaa...! It hurts so much! How can I be so angry over such a small mistake? Celta, you are so sweet, I didn't mean to cheat on you! Old cars are so hard to maintain. It's just being repaired! It doesn't want to disturb you! I could barely see the road! Don't lie to me anymore, Flea. Thank you for being alive. If you see her again, you will die. Of course! Never Celts! May the writer be forgotten. You will always be my guest!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_BREW : Dodson! Miss Hornet? Welcome to our new camp! Come on, let's drink! Nothing energizes you like our free premium beer! Kill it. Crispy and warm! Did you lose in football? Come get a free beer! You go upstairs to warm up. I'm still here brewing, so drink as much as you want, don't worry. I will be back for more!
TROUPLE_HUNTER_MEET_COMPLETE_ACT3 : Are you still a flea, not a parasite? Although you ask for help, I have nothing to give you. All the fleas are collected here. Well, they better stick together.
TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET_NOMAP : The big bay. I wasn't too worried about finding this company because you have so many friends. Be a guide between you and your friends and tell me about this difficult task of yours. Hmm... It's my job to find them using my sense of smell and sharp senses. I'm going to find their mosquito friends, especially the ones they had as children, and strengthen them. If you have seen fleas in other ways, can you tell me? Maybe I can safely direct them to the company. Go back to basics! I can tell you the money, but you don't have a card to identify it! If you want information, you need a map. We can't do anything first.
FG_DODGE_INTRO_FIRST : Oops! The world is ending. Now all you have to do is prove your worth. This challenge is a complete puzzle. Stay on the platform and avoid the attacks. Stay there until you reach the most points. Solve the problem and become the master. That is your only remaining objective.
FG_DODGE_INTRO_CHAMP : I'm sorry, you are the strongest in this fight. But you need to test your peers. Can you delete your certificate?
TROUPE_HUNTER_ACT3_MEET : "So come back, insects and mosquitoes. The world is over. The end is near," said the bay. "This land is gravely wounded, but death does not come with it. Now it is my duty to save this kingdom from the darkness of the ruins. Hmm... those words are pure fantasy. Now I have only one thing to protect."
FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_REPEAT : Come and join the celebration! Challenge the young! Throw a flea into the air. Try to stay in the air as long as possible!
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_CANLEAVE_FIRST : Master Paras, I have found a cave behind the castle, next to an old canal. It could be the perfect place to take refuge. It's a long walk, but when you get there, you'll see a large, clear lake above the sandy beach, untouched by enemies. The most peaceful place I have seen in these dangerous lands. There it is! Indeed! The destination is set. The journey continues! Massa Hornet, faithful friend of Piraeus. The place will definitely welcome us. Will you join us on this trip?
TROUPE_HUNTER_ALL_FLEAS_FOUND_ACT3 : They are all here. Lice are not fleas. We have a trailer full to catch them. Demand seems better. Whatever happens, we are ready.
CARAVAN_LECH_SAVED : Wow, that's cute! It's so fun to be in a weird cave! This country is full of electric wires that will catch you if you fail. But it sure doesn't seem so scary now. This metal cart is... yours? Hey, that's right! Follow the Flea Association. The more, the safer, right? Traveling alone gets boring. See you soon! It has a secret trailer hidden inside. I will tell you a secret the next time they meet! Hahaha!
TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_WISHWALL_QUEST1_FULL : Well, we had a great time because the train was packed. Our bays will definitely be on board! Oh, how lazy I am! What should I tell you first? My name is Hornet, a flea. I love you and I'm glad to see that the rest of the fleas in the company are doing well. This country is dangerous for those traveling alone. Ah, how lovely! How beautiful! All together. My friend Sir Hornet. Our company will soon be leaving for the vast lands up there. Will you join our guest on this trip?
TROUPE_HUNTER_PURCHASED : I made the wrong map for you. See what the world's extinct insects have learned. As I told my flea friend: find them if you dare. Hello, six years old
TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ALLRESCUED : Miss Hornet, true flea friend, you are always welcome! Give him everything he wants. May he rest and heal. All our fleas are waiting for you.
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_READYTOLEAVE_NO_LAKE_REPEAT : Friend, please! If you find a large and empty cave, come and let us know immediately. The bays are waiting for you. I hope you come safely!
TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_ACT3 : Oh, blue. My travels through these countries have been long and extensive, and wherever I've gone I've met people like you, humble and curious. Flea, you have a wonderful sense of chance, and although few have matched your genius, I continue to admire you. I had been used to traveling alone for a long time, but accompanying you on a trip, and even helping you a little, has brought back fond memories. And how you've made us all happy, Flea! As the evening draws to a close, I am proud to present to you one last treasure from the once famous tribes of Balochistan. May your footsteps follow us into the last Faram.
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_JUDGE : Mr. Bumblebee, be happy! You don't have fleas. All that sand that dances around you is stored!
TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_REPEAT : Are the animals here scary? Are you still scared? But if you keep your distance, they give you space. If you worship them, they will fear you.
FG_DODGE_INTRO_GAMESCOMPLETE : Grand Master... a bug named Hornet. Want to challenge the fleas again?
FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_GAMESCOMPLETE : Strong, great defender of love! Will you come with us and escape into the night?
TROUPE_LEADER_DELIVERY_FESTIVAL : Bellhart's messenger, Lord Flea, has brought everything you need for your visit. A kind gesture that makes our holidays so happy! These cute mosquitoes don't want to wander around like we do. We will do our best to keep you happy all year round.
CARAVAN_LECH_INTRO_MARROW : See you soon, Mr. Pio. I hope you got on the train safely. Hey, it's true! Hahahaha, thanks everyone! Ah, ha, what a noble heart! What is this wonderful name? 1. Her name is sweet and comforting. Are you beautiful Grace? Or maybe Sweet Nectar? I'm Hornet, my husband. Say what you want. Gradak! Absolutely. Absolutely. The crab is so cute! I'll let you in on a little secret. The car is also a relaxing spa. It must be strange. The hot water inside is warmer and cleaner than Salam! Hahaha! For a small fee I would like to stay inside!
FG_DODGE_ACCEPT : The trial against Matka Reynek begins. Hiss!
TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_ALREADYACCEPTED : I, Mr. Perry, agree with your article that appeared in the Belheart Review.
TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_TALK_1 : The lament the song expresses is the end of the old life... When it ends, our paradise will be destroyed. Dear fleas, one day they will all die.
TROUPE_LEADER_FOUND_FLEAS : Here! These lovely insects have arrived! What a joy! I am already grateful! I wish there were more! Maybe I'm looking for my lost friends!
TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_MEET_NOCARAVAN : Hmm, a worm, not a flea. Why does it bother me? It's my place and I fought for it. I won't be long, ma'am. I am not asking you to reclaim this cave. But what is one to do in this soft place? A warrior? My warrior is old, but in this place, where danger lurks outside the door, there is no point in talking. I'm going out now. I find the bay and join my friends. Well... hmm... get out! Soon I go outside and find another flea. Fleas may be alone, but better together! Back to the land they used to be in! Get out, worm!
TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_REOFFER : Dear... Miss Hornet! Excuse me, I want to ask you something. Shall we meet at the last concert?
TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_ACCEPT_2 : It's flea season! Let's celebrate one last time before the black earthquake plunges us into darkness! One last time of the flea problem! Let the games begin!
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_LEAVE : Ah! Ah! Have a nice trip! Your new home is calling. A new adventure begins! Have a good trip, Mr. Flea. Have a nice trip.
TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_QUEST_SKIP_FULL : But she's still a guest! Hear the miracle that happened while she was with us! Haven't you seen all the fleas that were gathered in our group? We have seen so many! An incredible number of people, but here they are all safe and sound. Our biggest wish has come true! You were looking for fleas to join the group and I found and rescued many along the way. Oh! Really? So you are our savior, dear mosquito friend! Everything went so fast! And now the car is loaded and silent. Our fleas must go deeper! Oh Salvatore, how lazy I was! What if I had called you earlier? Call me the wasp, lady flea. I love you and I'm also happy to see my fly friends safe and sound during sex. It is a dangerous country to visit alone. Ah, Webender! Wonderful, wonderful! How beautiful! Everything. My dear best friend... Miss Wasp. Prepare for our journey into the vast wilderness. Will you be joining us as a guest?
CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_INTIMIDATED : Oh, how cool I am! Doddushona! Oh, hi! He was tired after the trip. Oh, to receive such a gift from a guest! How wonderful! Enjoy this free spark! Dear Cleat, I will gladly give it to you!
FESTIVAL_OUTRO_PRE : Miss Vespa! You have proven yourself time and time again in the flea games! We are confident that the winner of our party will be crowned. Come on! Now let's start the closing party. Are you ready for the bay?
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_FESTIVAL : Miss Vespa is Pulce's friend. Let's drink together and have fun. Enjoy the moment before it's over! All the glasses are ready! You can refill them if needed. The future is written, so there's no point in wasting it.
TROUPE_LEADER_INFO_LECH : A wonderful flea has joined us. We all wait but something strange happens. His car is like a cannon, but the price of pearls is too high, especially for us. Considering the safety of us and our friends, is this right?
FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE : Viconia! Unbelievable! It's amazing that you can always be angry!
TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_REPEAT : Bed bugs or fleas, are you there yet? Is there anything I should do before getting off the bus? This is an uncomfortable conversation. You see, he enlightened me. Fill in the blank. I'm sorry, ma'am. Continue your powerful journey. See you on the bus with your friends.
FG_JUGGLE_DECLINE : of titles. Want to try sports?
TROUPE_HUNTER_REPEAT_NOMAP : Hmm... It's not a flea, it's a worm. Want to know more about my work? But you don't have money to buy a ticket! You won't be able to use it if you don't.
CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_ACCEPT : Thank you! Thank you! I loved this delicious scented ornament! I invite you to participate too!
FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED_CHAMP : Viconia! My friend, dancer, you have proven yourself a master in every war! No one can beat your twenties. You surprise everyone with your amazing beauty! But are you going to let me keep playing? The world doesn't have to end by itself.
TROUPE_LEADER_QUEST1_TRAVEL_ACCEPT : Hey, hey! Come on, let's go! Wake up, fleas! The train is coming!
FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_REPEAT : Hey, why don't you try playing Fa Sul again? Place bets, jump and avoid mistakes as much as possible!
TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_SETH : "Do you want that new flea sitting there, Dodashnia?" "It's old, but it plays!" Don't worry, Grishkin is probably just annoying. I will make him tea and introduce him to more insects.
TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_JUDGE : "Miss Wasp, we'll stay here a little longer and wait for more fleas to arrive. Any fleas I find, I'll send to you, Mr. Flea."
FESTIVAL_POT_TAKE_BREW : Do you want to drink football?
FESTIVAL_BOARD_TITLE_BOUNCE : repent
TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED : It's been strange, Lord Flea. I have traveled all over the country and seen your kind and curious presence almost everywhere. Lopers have a wonderful sense of humor and I admire you even though you don't have that talent. I traveled alone a long time ago, but the opportunity to accompany you on a journey and help you or bring a small sweet memory has become a reality. You've made our fleas happy too! Mr. Hornet, and one more thing: the treasure of the once famous Bug clan. I hope you will always be my friend.
CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_ACCEPT_INTIMIDATED : The spa is at your service, my client! And caring and kind people like you, always at your service... hey, hey...
CARAVAN_LECH_SAVED_REPEAT : If I'm lucky, I'll see you again when you join the forum. I have a secret in my special basket and I'm sure I'll share it with you the next time we meet!
TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_ACCEPT_1 : There is an agreement. O men, prepare yourselves! The time has come, the time has come!
TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_FLEATOPIA_REPEAT : Sometimes the lake is very big. Well, no chicks, rest here.
TROUPE_LEADER_QUEST1_TRAVEL_DECLINE : It's a shame, but I know. I'm sure the road will end soon. Come, come! Get up, fleas! The train is coming!
FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_GAMESCOMPLETE : The most important part is over, let's have fun! Miss Grandmaster Vespa, show us the magic bay!
TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_TRAVEL : Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Even fleas would be happy to join our friends on their next trip! Let's go!
FG_BOUNCE_ACCEPT : Mom! A wonderful game begins! The bays have jumped!
TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_READYTOLEAVE_NO_LAKE : Until he becomes an expert, no one will persecute him. I have explored many caves in this world, but I have not found one as safe and spacious as yours. If I ever find one, I'll let you know.
FESTIVAL_BOARD_SPIRIT_NAME : Flyer
FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_FIRST : I miss Bumblebee, what role do you play? Even if the world falls apart, we'll still laugh, jump and leap! Come with us and play classic games! My time is up, so carte blanche. If you participate, you will remind me to sharpen my skills for bigger challenges ahead. Absolutely! Absolutely! Just for fun! Miss Bumblebee, I'm all for excuses! Let's do free magic! Let's throw some chips and see who can keep them in the air the longest. It's an honor to challenge our lovely guests to this game!
CARAVAN_LECH_WOUNDED_REPEAT : My training was a mistake! I will not do it again! Oops! I will not do it again!
TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET : A giant flea. Between you and me, I had no doubt you would survive this venture. Can you then tell me of the discovery which took place between you and your friends, which has made you a formidable creature in your eyes? Hmmm... it's a worm, not a boy! My job is to follow the trails using my sharp senses and perception. I will find and collect my friends' mosquitoes, especially the small ones, so they can heal. If you see more fleas, let me know. We can transport them safely to your company. Dersim. Because you don't end with "ta-da"; it's a worm, not a flea. Margaret! Give it to me and I'll tell you how I feel. How strong and how long I feel. It's worth it; I make money.
TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ACT3 : I can't believe so many doubts led me here... Honestly, I never thought I would be surrounded by such wonderful companions. But alas! The world has become so dangerous that there could be even more mosquitoes around. They will attack us!
TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ALLRESCUED_ACT3 : The parts are recovered, but a huge explosion shakes the earth and marks the end. We are few but this seems to be the last area. Only one will remain but it will take time to prepare. Dear friend, if you are still traveling, I hope you will join us.
TROUPE_LEADER_FLEATOPIA_HUNTER_HINT : Miss Hornet, I saw flea tracks nearby: flea hunters! They usually give off a strong, pungent smell, but they are still useful for sex. If mosquitoes with such a rare ability find a place among their friends, they can increase their defenses and other strengths. If you want to contribute to the development of our village, you let them drip over the fence.
FESTIVAL_POT_INSPECT : A jar full of secret fleas.
TROUPLE_HUNTER_MEET_COMPLETE : Thanks again, Big Flea. With so many friends, I didn't have to worry about finding that company. Can you greet your friends and tell them about this terrible mission? Hmm... My job was to track them down, use my senses and my nose. Finding and collecting my friends, especially the mosquitoes of my childhood, so they could heal. That was my biggest project! But now it's different. All the mosquitoes are safe here. There aren't many of them! Cheers and food!
TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_CANLEAVE : Look! These healthy fleas have gathered in our company. Thanks to you and your research, our numbers have increased dramatically. Perhaps one day we will retrace the famous old trail. It's wonderful to see so many fleas alive and well, Mr. Flea. Your cheerfulness helps your admirable care grow. What a word, Mr. Bumblebee! How lucky we are to have such wonderful friends! But we can't go any further! We are tired of this desert. It's time to enter the driest caves! My friend, Flea, will you join us on our next trip?

I met fleas to build your traveler. Maybe you want to join them? The fleas seem strong, but I fear they will not last long on this earth. A car? Hmm. I've felt it firsthand... It's time for a change. As the county approaches, my duty in this country will soon end. Hmm... Hmm. We have been talking for a long time. Bye! You are in company. That's how I learned about fleas and medicine. You need a way to rest! Bugs, go away!

Many authors seem to have met a more dire fate. Indeed! Bright descendants await us! It is done for you and your hard work. Please give us some hospitality to celebrate our arrival.
