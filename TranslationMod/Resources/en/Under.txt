ARCHITECT_AFTER_SHRINE : I have touched the Guru, the great temple. Your starting tech is drawn from another mechanical heart. I have to prepare something for the master. Red Scarab, you are the first organic shell to use our memory. From my background this seems impossible. However, your vast arsenal indicates a mechanical connection strong enough to access our mental memory. Your art is wonderful, guru. Thank you for the insight.
CONFESSIONAL_START_BROKEN : Conversation... Confession...
ARCHITECT_WEAVER_SHOOT : Red Scarab, your craft is excellent. Was this broken tool made by a weaver? Absolutely, sir. There are the remains of an old factory in the burning caves opposite the palace. This thing looks like a weapon made of wire. If I had infinite time I would repair it myself. The artist's work is a great compliment to the skill of his sons. They set the standard for Nechachi Pum tools and techniques. I can recreate this tool if you want, but I will do so at my own discretion.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_SILKSHOT : A wonderful instrument made by the firstborn Faram. This weapon can be repaired and rebuilt, but it will surely retain some trace of mine and Didi's ingenuity.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_TALK_REPEAT : Looking for our Red Beetle service? We create, risk our lives. We serve the platform forever.
CONFESSIONAL_START : Speak now, your confession will be heard.
LARGE_COG_WORK_SONG : Lips, lips. Your voice is pure. When I hear that, I miss the world. It reminds me of my childhood. When I think of that voice, the work becomes more difficult. I have to keep working. Please my friend, stop this panic.
ARCHITECT_WILL_LEAVE : Red Bell, oh, I serve you... When my work is done, I must speak, I admit. For a long time I have felt the slowness of the rotor blade. My limbs are weak. I feel the end coming, suddenly, finally... Thank you. Here, your chance doesn't matter. You have created the perfect tool for your art. What will happen after death? Will there be room for you? No one can. The ability to create an architect has taken my time. I'm the last one... the last one. The core that sustains the song remains but there are no architects to work or rebuild. "Forum Eternity," says Emperor Cage. But how can eternity last without the work of architects? It seems like a mistake n-n. The end? Error... Welcome?
LARGE_COG_WORK_MEET : Hmm. Hmm. who are you I can't see you clearly... Don't be afraid, Ogun. I don't want to hurt you. Huh? Hmm! Now I see you! So pure, so alive... You truly came out on top! My time has finally come! That's my job. You came to me! Get up, get up! Hmm. You don't understand me. I am not a palace dweller. I am there, but I am not an enemy. Hmm. Hmm. What will happen next? I have been completely misunderstood. Finally, abandon false hopes! Obviously my work is not done! There is more! I have more to do!
ARCHITECT_SHOP_TALK_REPEAT_ACT3 : Red bell. Do we still need our electricity? We still have a long way to go, but we can do something for you if you want.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_KEY : If the Red Bug can demonstrate his ability to use our tools and such, he will be given a key that will allow him to enter the room upstairs.
ARCHITECT_MELODY : Guru, I want the honey hidden in your words. The key to overcoming obstacles is to be consistent. Teach me this? Our lives? I remember! Yes! Once upon a time there was a song. But that voice... doesn't follow me anymore. Its trace has been erased from the secret fund of my mind. Like many things... they interfere with the memories... but you still feel them. At the core of our core is virtually a mass media. We just need to train them formally.
ARCHITECT_MELODY_RETURN : Bagard, have we entered the great center? We are amazed by all the architects that have passed through here, including myself. Our paths lead us in many directions, Gurudev. But the time will come when we go into the heart and sing the songs from above.
LARGE_COG_WORK_CITADEL : Do you know that castle on the hill? I haven't been there for a long time. Sorry! The castle! A holy, famous place, in a magnificent location! Plenty of clean water! The air is clean and you can admire the ceiling from above! When I think about that castle, I work harder than anyone else! Sorry!
CONFESSIONAL_END : Confess your grave sin. Clear your karma. Before the new cycle begins, return to work effortlessly, even without eating. By the grace of the eternal state I never tire. Work hard and you will be set free.
LARGE_COG_WORK_TOGETHER : Hmm! Hmm! Okay, okay! If we work together we can become even holier! We can work together too! Let's work together until God knows our worth!
ARCHITECT_MELODY_GAINED : What is that, Red Beetle? I have also heard your work here. I have an author. It seems that it was a simple insect that grew unexpectedly. And I am lucky that your country's technology has given me the opportunity to grow. Wonderful songs and sounds, hearing and sight. Even in this fleeting moment your art shines with its brilliance. Extraordinary... work... age... Redbell, you are the soul of our architecture... a source of inspiration. What an award we have created...
ARCHITECT_MEET_ACT3 : You, sir, seem to be the only builder left in this abandoned castle. are you my enemy The other buildings here have vehemently protested my existence. Red bell? I am a builder. YES. The enemy is no. I am an engineer. Just an architect. Construction, automation, sequence of issues, N-N rails. Red Beetle, what are you doing here? Time passes more slowly. Architect... Do you need architectural services? You are a weaver, eldest. Rarely... Are you extinct? I doubt it. My Lord, you know it's true. I am a weaver, a unique and unusual breed. At your command, Redbell, at your command;
ARCHITECT_MEET : Expert, this seems to be the only creator in the palace. are you my enemy The other structures here are in stark contrast to my existence. Red bell? I am the creator. YES. The enemy. No, I'm an engineer. There is only one architect. Automation in construction is impossible. This is our normal order. You are a weaver, one of the elders. Is the Lal-ee family extinct? I don't think so. Guru, you know it's true. I am the origin of the weavers and my other species are alien. At your command, Red Bell, at your command, the greatest, you have received our eternal kingdom. I will make K-K.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_TITLE : The twelfth architect
LARGE_COG_WORK_WORK : Hmm. The harder we work, the faster we go. Those up there are always watching us. If we work hard and are slow, we will rise. Hmm. My husband, have you forgotten yours so much? Isn't it time for a rest? I understand how these worries torment you. Huh? Hmm. Strange, I can't rest. We are winning, the court breathes, the princess is queen and everything is fine. And if we work, they see... hmm... they see, and we reap divine fruit.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_TOOL_KIT : My tools. You can wash your hands. It's harder and faster.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_SCUTTLEBRACE : The flexible coating increases the flexibility of the material and gives it a protective effect.
CONFESSIONAL_END_BROKEN : Worst... pure... ... the deed... the beginning... the stage... never forgiven
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_COGWORK_SAW : Do radial wings inspire you? You can use this idea and knowledge to turn it into a business.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_KEY_REQUIRE : {0} Use additional tools to show off your skills.
LARGE_COG_WORK_REPEAT : Hmm. I have nothing to say, friend. We have been persecuted. We have to work hard.
AUTO_SHRINE_DOOR_INSPECT : The door bearing the artist's coat of arms.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_SHARDPOUCH : The raw material of creativity. Always keep them with you, ready to use.
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_KEY_REQUIRE_SINGLE : You get another tool that helps you develop your skills.
ARCHITECT_COG_HEART : Tell me about their subjects... The Order of the Shining Spheres, the Guardian Gears, their roles are grand and magnificent, and the duties they perform are extremely sacred...
ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_BROLLYSPIKE : "That metal strip is sharp and very thin. Could it be attached to the red dress? It could also be a hidden weapon."
