HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_PROMPT : Want to buy old Vin' Amrit?
HH_BARTENDER_GREET_ACT3 : Greetings, travelers! The world was shocked by the terrible events and it was good to see someone alive. This new curse has become a threat even to my strong body. Ladies, to be safe, I strongly advise you to stay indoors. And so you will be. Wake up, drink a few drops of Madhu and forget all your worries…
HH_BARTENDER_CURSED : Hmm. You seem a little upset, ma'am. I don't think my honey alone can cure you. Some parasites from your country have penetrated my shell. Their tremors are very disturbing. If it wasn't for our condition, they would have eaten me long ago. Don't bring such dangerous things here! Deeper into the wilderness. There you will find an old woman hiding under a glass dome. It's well known that drugs do more harm than good, but given your situation, I think it's worth the risk.
HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_OFFER : Oh my god, I asked for ancient honey. Is that possible? Something nice to show you the honey. I'm sure it's still there, but I can't sell it. The shells I have in the basement are the last of the Faroma shells. If they escape, no worm will ever taste this sweet again.
HH_BARTENDER_DRINK_DECLINED : However, it is surprising that some people need food due to their unique nature. what do you think If we want, we can always eat honey.
HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_REOFFER : Thinking of buying old juice again? My price may seem high, but the value of the worms I sell justifies the higher price.
HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_REPEAT : Could you please review my shrimp problem? Good luck to you.
HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_QUEST : Madam, I don't mean to be too rude, but I hope someone as knowledgeable as you has an answer. I have my responsibilities, but I want you to know this. And Kakashi, with his work on this roof, makes my peak a comfortable haven for these people! They become bolder and more aggressive, attacking strangers as they pass. Should I kill them? Your home is protected and ready for a challenge. I wish it was easy. If you kill them there, they will keep coming. However, the warmth of this home attracts them. I am looking for a long term solution. I encourage you! We will build the best Ansenkyo ever. I fear Kakashi's son will not live here forever!
HH_PATRON_LEFT_TALK_1 : How glad I am to have found this place, sister! The climb was harder than I expected, but my limbs were still strong. Now my stomach is full of honey.
HH_BARTENDER_REPEAT : "Mr. Guest, is there anything you would like? My love will keep you warm in this humid climate."
HH_PATRON_RIGHT_TALK_1 : Hello... sister! I will sit here and adore you, and everything will be fine, just like the day you were born! How will you survive in this humid, dangerous land? Do you have any secrets you can teach me? It's no easy secret, my friend. What happiness, what knowledge has brought him here! I hope you continue on your path.
HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_DECLINE : Ministers, this is not the time to beg you now. Have mercy. Fancy a cheap drink? Rise up before we leave this desert.
HH_BARTENDER_BELLHARTHAUNTED : On the way, following the sound of the old clock, you will find yourself near an abandoned village. The citizens there were bound by the ominous rope. Sorry! Does the curse of the Light bind them? Restless. Not much is known about the other side. Employees may warn your customers. If you overstep your bounds, you better leave. Sorry! Tourist, without me telling you. But in cursed times, is it still a safe way?
HH_BARTENDER_CURSED_REPEAT : "You need to go to the doctor now, madam! He's in the desert, near the clock tower. His methods may be questionable, but he really needs help."
HH_PATRON_LEFT_TALK_REPEAT : It took me a while to meet the spirits but now I feel them coming... the palace is calling me.
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE : The cloth is torn here. Hope, yes. Obviously so. As soon as I have some time, I start preparing this giant cucumber. I hope I can protect myself from these insects next time I come. Thank you, travelers!
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_ACTIVE : When the shrimp are removed, they have less surface area and less food. Be careful with the cooked shrimp on the other side of the mizuki. Many fall off. But if you try to tell the cracked shell from a real shrimp, it's hard to tell the difference…
HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_GOT : Come back, lady! There is a bit of confusion there. Is everything working fine? Mari, it looks like the ants are at the base. Or did you forget to tell me when you sent me? Oh...! Ouch! Weapons, characters and problems right...? Umm, why? You have received your reward. Thank you both equally! Be happy, madam. Not one drop of this miracle has reached a stranger.
HH_BARTENDER_DECLINE_QUEST : Ah, the journey. I know what you are doing. I'm sure of that too.
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_2 : As a reward, I gave you something I desperately need: I'm looking for the rest of my jewelry. I had kept it for a while, but it has been sitting in the closet for so long that I know it will never come back.
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_3 : Thank you for This is a great study in my field. These tools should be put to better use.
HH_PATRON_RIGHT_TALK_REPEAT : When you reach the palace, the pain of the armor will be relieved. It is said that crossing the threshold will cure all ills.
HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_ACCEPT : Ah! It's really a lot. There are some big shots in here. I hope you get the strength you deserve. I want to follow my own path, but stubbornness won't let me deviate.
HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_1 : Now let only the brave pilgrims reach my home... the rest suffer from Faram's curse. The journey will be painful for days. Sometimes I wonder... Is there a dialectic that drives them, or is it something else?
HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_2 : Belhart, across the desert. I once heard of a beautiful village. In the heart of the Mediterranean, at the crossroads of all roads. But now all is gone... and something evil lurks in this fragile land. This forum is no longer secure.
HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_3 : Have you ever been to the Upper Rim? It is a very busy place; there used to be a farm with food and livestock. I think it was built for our mothers to live and work... and now the food is free.
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_CANCOMPLETE : Come back, tourist. How do you feel when you pull the rug off the screaming shrimp? "Gyaro's" screams and screams wear me out, man!
HH_BARTENDER_DRINK_PROMPT : offer you a drink
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_DECLINEPELTS : Wait a minute? I don't want to hear your arguments, but I really want to reconsider your opinion.
HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_PAID : Thinking of buying old rosaries? I brought some scattered rosaries; I am sure you will like them and will be happy to take them with you. These antique rosaries are kept in the basement. Hurry, the door is open.
HH_BARTENDER_GREET : Ah! Tourists, hello. Drink, rest, maybe both? Welcome, little guys. How pleasant the warmth of the fire in these damp fields. Ah, what a journey to the mountains! Once only strangers came here, but now they are few and it is not uncommon to see them. A noisy old man came in and rang the bell a while ago, and now my little girl lives upstairs. She says she is looking for a simple man like you. If you haven't met him yet, do you want to meet him?
HH_BARTENDER_ACCEPT_QUEST : Wow, wow! Let's go squish those bugs! What? I just need some shrimp wings. Take them, break them and bring me a fist. I can do it!
HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_ACTIVE_2 : The more fibers removed from the carpet, the better. You can't let these pests kill other customers. Business is already declining and the experience of removing these fibers is unpleasant.
HH_BARTENDER_REPEAT_ACT3 : "Tourists, do you have anything to drink? Looks like we're almost there, so keep your bow handy."
HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_QUEST_WISHWALL : Bucky, I got your request from the Belltown Wanting Wall. Do you need help? Oh! That's great! I'm sure you'll take care of it in no time. The problem is the shrimp. My shelter heats up quickly and it's worth it! They have become so airy that they have started attacking strangers who pass by. Do you want me to drive them away? Enough of your hard shell. I hope it is easy for you. Let's chase the shrimp; they reach bigger. Hey, the warmth of the house is tempting. I am looking for a long term solution. It's a squirrel! We will build the biggest squirrel house in the world. Let's banish those pesky squirrels away forever! Now we just need a shrimp with a sharp skin. You attack them, scare them away and bring them back into groups. I'll think about it later!
