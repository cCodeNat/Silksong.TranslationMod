PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_POST : It's amazing! Fighting against an opponent with so little energy. You are a true artist. I hope my training helps you.
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_MEET : Oh, rude man! Wake up from your deep meditation, Finsterster! If you keep being so rude I will block you immediately! It's amazing what a mere worm can do in such a hostile place. Are you a weapons expert in this country? Ah! Needle! Your needle may be useful to you. Weird... Pharom's weapon is a leg needle. Now that I'm awake, why don't I exercise a bit? Maybe I should try the power of the needleman? Maybe this old master can teach you something.
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_TALK_ACT_3 : I haven't felt this good in years. Don't let all those pesky strangers test my skills. Finster, your sword was truly a wonderful experience. I destroyed an entire kingdom and I'm still in awe of its strength and skill. Yes, otherwise you shouldn't have a foreign power. If only we could meet at a more convenient time, we could learn so much from each other!
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_ACCEPTED : Strong man, stinging octopus. Come on, move your head, will you?
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_PROMPT : Want your needle to sharpen your focus?
WORLD_EDGE : These sands mark the edge of the Faram world. I was transported to these lands through a cave. Something above this plain longs for me still; now, if I run away, they will find me. Until I find that desire and return, I will never be free.
PINSTRESS_NPC_TALK_01 : Find stress_NPC_TALK_01
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_STAND_MEET : Are you back, little pillow? Is there a place at the top of those sandy steps that calls to you? I've missed you for a while, little pillow. Your home and your abilities give you a sense of security rarely found in places like this.
STEEL_SENTINEL_QUEST_REPEAT : Find the vassal... bring him back... save us from the Lord's wrath.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_MEET_RETURN : I'm a pillow! In this dark earthquake, Pharaoh's end is near. Draw your swords! At least one of us must be true to our nature!
PINSTRESS_FINAL_MEET : Ah! A little pillow! Is that what makes Pinstress so powerful? Have you forgotten my wish? Do you want to try to make it come true? Little pillow, I know what you want... There is no duel to the death here, no end to the war, no cave collapse. I can give you a point... But the best proof is that you are still underground. What are you trying to do? Maybe it's been too long, little pillow. Black as an earthquake. The end of the lighthouse has come. Should we end this conversation? shall we start Let's see who among you is at least true to nature!
STEEL_SENTINEL_REOFFER : Was he superior...or...had he been sent by his slave master...to Earth to retrieve a lost soldier?
STEEL_SERVANT_END_1_ACT3 : No, no, no... Our patron is dead! What are you doing, cruel, tortured creature? Why do I have to serve you so long, so long, so long? This place, this unspeakable warm worm. Now, by force, it has set out to destroy the land. The shout will be muffled, unless it increases the destruction. I'm sure your shell is safe now. Guided by the iron strength of my friends and the fear of my master's punishment, I approach my goal step by step.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_DEFEATED_PRE : Ah! You have won a handsome man and you are trying to stop him? The pressure is too much! I'll prove to myself what happens next, but I won't beat you. Earthquakes are coming, but the destruction of the lighthouse is not as inevitable as it seems. They are trying to stop me. For my mission to succeed, the rest of the world will need wild insect eyes like yours to watch over you. Unbelievable! You dream of the market of the future and think only of the past. What a stupid insect... it's like I've been stabbed twice with a needle, because of the determination of my heart...
STEEL_SENTINEL_ACCEPT : Even if he's not my boss, we can offer Yo-Yo our help, if it's the right way. I met one of the assistants. Badass, badass and master of stealth. If Yo-Yo is a slave to his nature, it will be difficult to return. Where do we start looking? He knew their movements... he knew their location. Blue and white... Let's discover the sea pictures. Let them find their bonds... Save them, or save their bodies... Which is the right way? Which is more useful? Let us flee from the wrath of the Lord.
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_MEET_ACT_3 : Oh, you rude man! Distract Finn Streater from his deep thoughts! If you act so impudently, you will perish in an instant! It's a miracle that a worm can live in such a harsh place. Are you perhaps an expert in weapons in this country? Ah! Find Streater! May the needle be of use to you, but you certainly have a great weapon, Faram, Finn... Faram looked young. But now that he is awakened and suddenly arrives at this moment, why should he not move? Maybe this old man can teach you something?
PINSTRESS_NPC_REPEAT : Pin Voltage_NPC_Repeat
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_SIT_TALK_REPEAT : Come, come, worm. I fear you and your sharp sword, but do not abuse my hospitality.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_ICECORE_VISITED : "King Bug, you may know, but deep in this mountain lies a hidden spark. It seems incredible," my sister once said. "Giant large crystal cave. "Margarita," I have been inside your heart. This is truly a wonderful place. I hope you will not lose it anytime soon. You are sure of it! A skilled swordswoman and explorer, you have proven your abilities. But since you are so tired, maybe it is time to go back to work?"
STEEL_SERVANT_END_2 : But the prophet knows nothing. He does not feel pain. However little pain Sula has to endure... We are alone. What?... Others can feel this pain too, worm... Or at least something similar. So you drag me back? Will you deliver me to the edge of the sword and remember these pains carefully? ... No. I'll tell White Steel what happened here, but I can't force the worm to commit such cruelty again. Therefore... Will it be possible for Sula to be free? Or at least escape? O worm, by your grace let those feet run, run, far, far away!
STEEL_SENTINEL_REPEAT : Let him see, notice and prepare. He is always faithful to his role and duties.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_DEFEATED_REPEAT : My friend, it was a very hard fight. Now continue your valuable work. I wish you lasting success.
STEEL_SENTINEL_OFFER : ...It's a high level meeting... the boy wakes up... No accident... you send this boy, right? Did he serve the Lord? ...Returning a lost vassal?
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_SIT_TALK_01 : Finn Strace, why would you want to live in the middle of the cave? This place must have been more comfortable. Someone, sweet and warm, said, "I just want to escape!" How do you keep second row? Is it a secret place? Apparently the hill isn't a bastion of free or powerful allies who prefer solitude...right? Sure. It's something, but it's sad. We, the great patron, have learned the training of the ancient Finns, Strace. And you followed that order! We were superior in skill, but few in number, and your power was great. Our honorable soldiers – two men – have already fled to the corner of the forgotten lighthouse, and our sister Finn has turned to peaceful pursuits.
WORLD_EDGE_REPEAT : I can't leave this country yet. My thirst for kingdom will not be quenched until I destroy its source.
STEEL_SENTINEL_DECLINE : To make a mistake... To leave this position? Does your master subjugate you and hold you down? .... You know that obedience is necessary. It also reminds you of the fate of those who rise... You too, you too, you too, above all you, you too...
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_DECLINED : Hi, are you embarrassed to show your needle tip? What a shame!
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_STAND_REPEAT : Hospitality has its limits. I am used to being alone and it is not easy for the power of strangers to subjugate me for so long.
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_REOFFER : Mr. Chimchong, can you wait a moment? Maybe you can move. Maybe you can test your salivary pressure. Maybe this experienced teacher can teach you something.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_REOFFER : Worm, have you interfered in our game? Take care! I will not drop my sword. I expect the same from you.
STEEL_SENTINEL_MEET : ... Elder... Scarab... Ironborn, hello. I've met you before. Based on your behavior, these areas also seem to attract the attention of the teachers. Master... yes... the fall... has always yielded... and you... are a twofold creature.
STEEL_SENTINEL_OFFER_NO_MAP : ...Survival... This encounter, this awakening... Is it possible that a lost vassal has returned? But... Yellow, that's impossible. Yellow, I admit it. It was the first time I showed signs of being lost.
STEEL_SENTINEL_END_1 : Your surviving soldiers have fled these lands. Although your will was not fulfilled, I was happy to forgive their escape. will you No... blue and white... Ji clearly sensed your meeting... Consciousness. They have touched the darkness. Because of your master, no matter how hard they are, they will be exiled. What is probably best for your vassals? Become slaves here or escape to freedom? They have made a decision and in doing so they have declared it dark. The Guardians of Darkness have perished, but they can escape through luck or treachery. Hope! .... Blue... For these donkeys who are against their master?... Do you think, Ji, this is complicated... The result will be different... And Ji must now defend himself.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_DEFEATED_POST : "Needle, accept this medal for your skill, your sword, your strength and control. I never thought you would join us alone, but you are better than anyone else."
WORLD_EDGE_ACT3_REPEAT : I can't run away. I cannot leave this realm of my destruction.
STEEL_SENTINEL_REOFFER_NO_MAP : Be a great man... come back when you get the letter. These letters are very important for your service and support to Swami.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_DECLINE : Ah... what a shame! Is there a better ending to this game? Without swords we must accept our fate in this new and terrible disaster.
STEEL_SERVANT_RITUAL : Stop cursing me, you stupid worm! You ask for freedom, but ask for a savior, and it will only give you death.
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_TALK : I haven't felt this good in years. Migrants are not meant to prove themselves to be obnoxious geniuses. Indeed, your sword was a unique experience. The hidden powers and technologies of this world have always fascinated me. Snake, you have amazing powers. I believe in powers beyond what you have told me. What do you use to get them?
STEEL_SERVANT_END_1 : No No... My warrior is dead! What are you doing, cruel and cruel? Why do I have to stay here and serve you for so long? I will never take this viral disease lightly. No one can control it, but many have tried. You will soon prove that the strength you seek is illusory. I imagine you are on time. The will of your friends and the fear of divine punishment have kept your arms in irons.
WORLD_EDGE_ACT3 : If I decide to do something, I will blame Fara for the destruction I have caused. As long as I live and can do something, I will never feel such an end.
PINSTRESS_FINAL_ICECORE : You probably already know this, but it's amazing that it's hidden deep in this mountain. According to my sister, this amazing place is a huge crystalline cave. If you have time, definitely explore this hill. Of course, you have to go in first, but if you're ready, I'll show you the way.
STEEL_SENTINEL_END_2 : To you, a small gift, pure and innocent... the creativity of the earth and the birth of the son, an idea, a complexity, a stone. Let it be the foundation of your future endeavors on this planet.
PINSTRESS_INTERIOR_GROUND_REPEAT : Come on, pillow, come out! A blind man with such abilities and I could meditate deeply, especially after fighting so well. Goodbye, Finster. May your sword always be sharp.
