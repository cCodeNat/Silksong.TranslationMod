SNAILS_ACT3_MEET_PT2 : It doesn't look good, old man. We did exactly what you said, didn't we? The ambush was foiled, and the animal was burned. You are stuck in the void! Don't be crazy. You know our nation's obsession very well. Did you have a prediction? Or perhaps you intended to capture a member of the blue and white family or inefficiently burn them? If so, you have made a serious mistake. A soldier on a white horse fell with his mother... oh, an earthquake...? I felt the power there too. Will she be able to resist the darkness... save her son? I think so. I must descend into the void and see the truth with my own eyes. Well... what a shame. Everything in Faroma is falling apart. Maybe, but I don't want to be there for nothing and fall for it.
GRINDLE_ITEM_TOOL_METAL : This product is quite heavy and the amount of light is amazing, so it is definitely worth buying!
GRINDLE_SHOP_REPEAT_ACT3 : When things get tough, so does the customer, haha! Okay, let's get started, shall we?
SPRINTMASTER_HERO_WIN_PRE_2 : Again... hmm... hmm. I can't believe it! Or a trip? Am I distracted? Or have I been waiting for you? Is my dream finally coming true thanks to your genius? Let's reward speed and agility. A true prize!
HUNTER_FAN_HINT_ZANGO : You, an adult, can you hear me? Outside the swamp, in a cave full of insects, countless changes are taking place. Nothing compares to fear except the dark. What causes such sudden and terrible changes? Animals? Or an invisible worm? How wonderful it would be to find them hidden in the deep! You, the adult, will find them! Sharpen yourself and this sharp sword. Imagine the surprise, wait for your comment to be added.
SHERMA_BELLHART_MEET : Ah, what a wonderful place! Police oysters with a golden lasso! Ha ha ha! This village now offers protection to strangers. What would have happened if I had been here? Thank God I made it this far. The road becomes more dangerous. Ah, how dangerous! But if such a wonderful miracle awaits me, then let's go have some fun, red maiden.
MAPPER_MEET_BONE_1C : Worms, you see lines on your palms, but childhood is over. What's going on here? I see signs of conflict.
HORNET_SILENCE : ,
MAPPER_WHITE_FLOWER_ACT3 : Shakra, the time is near. The price is high, the trials are hard, but I have found the strength to end the scourge. Paul... Oh, it's necessary. My strength reaches its limit and the Dark One's attack overwhelms. Let's take a risk and see what the outcome will be for all of us.
SETH_FESTIVAL_REPEAT_POST_MEMENTO : Your gaming performance is impressive! I hope that one day I can achieve such impressive results...
GARMOND_REPEAT : Gaiman, I congratulate you. If you seek justice for your fallen friends, you will be tried. Ha-ha! Ha-ha, I will fight to the bottom of the cave if necessary. I swear this by the serpent that lives in our hearts and by the honor of the soldiers.
GARMOND_AID_MEET_FORUM : Oh, do you like it too? The palace servants gather in groups! But if the three of us unite, we will be stronger! Brave sister, do you want to fight us?
GRINDLE_CITADEL_MEET : Ah! See what happens when a poor little boy attacks a little green boy. I think it's a fitting ending. I've heard that this old town was peaceful and kind, but what happened? Why is it finally full of robberies? The monster moved like a chibi thief. The castle lined up to the corridor. If you want to escape, get out of here as soon as possible. are you kidding me I'll stay here until the robbery is over! If you're that nervous, you have to go!
HUNTER_FAN_HINT_VOLTNEST : I had heard that far above the cave where they were kept was a huge pit full of chaos. The winding path and the noise. But alas! It was invisible. The earth shook and screamed. A thread of anger spread. It was a big risk. You are the one who has lost heart, the oldest, the oldest, the most serious. Find the cave and what's inside. Otherwise, the journal will remain incomplete.
HUNTER_FAN_ZAPNEST_MEET : Ah, dear No-chan, I want to see you again, No-chan. Wise No-chan knows how to follow in your footsteps. Look at the hills and smell the trails! And look where they lead, my Nei-chan! In this nest lives fat Oone-chan in the dark. The acidic liquid still clings to the rock. Patient Non-chan wants to learn everything! Nec-chan, there is much to learn in these rocky plains, but there are also many dangers. So indulge your curiosity, but keep your five senses alert.
SPRINTMASTER_HERO_LOSE : Destroy the bugs, don't leave them! If you still have energy, take the challenge. Let's escape together!
COURIER_SHORT_THANK_PT1 : Ah! These are dangerous creatures! Thank you, brave warrior! Don't worm unless they are overdue. Mr. Tips, are you a smuggler? A Frey merchant from Bellhart seems concerned about your safety and your goods. Did he send you, you fool? I have to be patient! How narrow-minded I have been! And yet... how lucky you are to be here!
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_CORALCAVERNS_NAME : Torn map of solitude
COURIER_SHORT_THANK_PT2 : OK, I'm going. That old pervert next door will destroy me if I don't give in!
SPRINTMASTER_HERO_WIN_AFTER_WISH_REPEAT : From now on I will teach you to be faster, deeper, faster, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_BELLHART_DESC : Vitaborg was built amidst a dense row of bells. Who built so many and why?
MAPPER_SPAR_INTRO : Corner, corner, stab! Following in his master's footsteps, he decided to hone his skills so that he could one day compete with him with all his might. But to achieve this goal, constant effort was required. I found this great dirt road: the perfect playground. Then why do you fight me? Draw your sword and test my skills in the arena! You may be my strongest opponent.
MAPPER_MAPPING : Shakra is a testament to your skill with maps and tools. Very few can answer that. Mapping! Hmmm! In the Karoo! The art is great with us. Knights should be careful. Map the caves, record your journey and know your place in the kingdom. Fascinating art for the warrior spirit. Until our grandfather never had it. The ability to disappear... it's amazing.
GRINDLE_SLAB_REPEAT : This ancient dungeon is full of treasures... The perfect place to catch fun little robots like Grindel! He really is alive! Oh wow!
HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_DECLINED_ACT3 : Oh, mother! You are an adult and still not going to ask for a census of our poor? What a shame! I'm sorry, what a shame. I appreciate your prayers, but my situation is very delicate.
HUNTER_FAN_GREET : Would you like to rest, Mr. Villa? Then show someone your newspaper. They want to see the clips!
SETH_CITADEL_MEET : Countless insects gave their lives to build this magnificent structure. Now you hear their deep wounds and the sound of their last breath. Everything that grows is temporary. However, the opportunity to present a magnificent vision is a privilege not to be missed. And which trumpet? Where does this journey lead? I have been invited from the heart. And in the future I will invite you more often. It is my duty to save these dark lands from fate. But this is a concern. I better go my own way and add my hooves to my weapon.
SHERMA_CARETAKER_MEET_B : Safe haven? Our home... it was all that was left after the disaster. A terrible crash echoed overhead. Everything shook and collapsed, a black thread rising from the underworld. Many pilgrims had already become victims of the disaster. If the fugitive strangers hadn't found you with them and arrested you, you could have been one of them. Black thread... I know where you're coming from. I have to talk to the elder. Do you know what happened to him? He left his clothes behind. That's right. He told me to leave the others here in my care and talk to his people down there. They're hiding down there... and in the lost chapel. He will teach them about their needs. Thank you, Sharma. Take care to stay safe and save other strangers from this trouble.
SHAKRA_GRAND_FORUM : Buchanalia! What a glorious victory! The cursed insects have been defeated and now the invasion is in your hands. We'll see you again soon, far from this terrible castle.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_JUDGESTEPS_DESC : There is a large cave that leads to Parus Castle. The road has been gradually eroded by sand and wind.
G_PRINCE_SONG_REPEAT : Hey Mr. Big Bug, see you soon. Otherwise death will take us both.
SPRINTMASTER_EXTRA_WIN_PRE : You are a doomed creature who has proven your worth time and time again. But I never tire of a challenge! I accept this trophy as a reward for my incredible perseverance. Remember my speed instructor and I'll show you what it should be.
SNAILS_ACT3_DEEP_MEMORY_REPEAT : The heart gives us an ancestor. Inappropriate, angry and determined by numbers. Before you burn your memory to save this land from insects, see the power of these forgotten people.
LACE_CITADEL_MEET2 : Who... Hahaha! Unbelievable! He knows unknown spiders and you dare challenge God... I saw you fight against us. Your path was destructive and painful. God's grace to stand before him. Be careful, my son. I know very few truly deserve the title of God. Experience teaches that even gods can fall.
MAPPER_GENERIC_WILDS : Power station, you feel at home in this desert. Pushanka! In this fiery field lie many paths and many battles. Will you approach the red skull in a convenient place, or will you resist with your ring? Such are the judgments of life! It is truly a miracle that these fragile pilgrims cross this hot and barbaric land.
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_STAG_REPEAT : This is the proof of our majesty... This is the proof of our divine authority.
SPRINTMASTER_OFFER_1 : So much! A malicious enemy has appeared. Finally! Finally! If you are looking for an opponent, choose a location nearby. Whether old men or insects, few dare to enter this deserted cave. Absolutely! But when you find one, which place is more suitable? Wounds are far from a huge, strong body. Here we can test our speed and agility to our heart's content. Go ahead! Challenger, are you ready to challenge me? Grant my wish! Let's defend our borders together!
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_UNFINISHED_MEET : Our royal ruler... our home is forgotten by my memory... Why have I forgotten? Why do I not remember this holy place?
GARMOND_ENCLAVE_REPEAT : Zaza and I will be here longer... We must take care of this stranger and do everything we can to fulfill this duty.
LACE_MEET_4_BRIDGE : This is an amazing look! I love you already! But you're not tired of losing yet. You are so close to our palace... Climb higher, spider. I want to use your challenges!
HUNTER_FAN_ZAPNEST_SLAP3 : But Noah is wise, he thinks. Adult mistakes are where heroes hide and they have a way out. The solution is coming. Well, that moment... it always comes.
GRINDLE_SLAB_2 : It seems you know this prison and its guards well. Do you know how to escape? Run! Little sadhu like no one you can escape from! Get out of here! Don't stand in the way! If you haven't stolen anything, no one will tell you.
GARMOND_DEFEATED_REPEAT : The fires of war have not yet gone out, but Jaja and I will soon have to part. The memories of this village still drive us. Greetings, my mighty sister!
SPRINTMASTER_OFFER_4 : I'm thinking of trying again, painful? You have proven yourself time and time again. This will definitely help you to increase your knowledge. After running, you better understand your limits and push yourself even further. Absolutely! I have a lot to learn from your wonderful career. Just a moment more and the track will be ready again.
LACE_MEET_3 : Threats are empty. If you are an enemy, be silent and draw your sword.
LACE_MEET_2 : I can save you, spider. From all the hardships and tribulations you will face in heaven. That is to say. I want to tear you away, right here, right now, and take your fragile life away from you.
LACE_MEET_1 : Sorry! The spider fell out of the cage. She was completely lost. He was completely helpless. He is so cute.
HUNTER_FAN_RESULT_1 : Wow, Mom, great start! Many creatures have been written about, but many are still unknown. Big brother, it's time to rest and go back to fishing!, Noni thinks.
GARMOND_DEFEATED_GNAT : Big brother! With all due respect! He was a cruel and stubborn creature, but we had no enemies. With pride! The insects of this earth will always sing our victory to their posterity!
LACE_TOWER_DEFEAT_1 : Hey... hahahaha! Come on, Spider-Man. I finally felt your bite. And you explained the truth about my poor, vain opinion. You smell old, son. You are not a worm. Your life, your life from nothing, acia. Life? How generous you are! Fragile, fragile. There was no pregnant life, pregnant propaganda. Your life was a life, white, blue man. Don't confuse your unique creativity with its absence. I have seen others make the same mistake. Is that a cliché, Spider-Man? Starting with you? Don't say anything to his face. Get up, get up and come. You deserve a visit. I met the Virgin Mary, who created a cruel and barbaric virgin like me.
GILLY_REPEAT : It's fun to talk about, but we have to be careful. And when we do, we often leave no trace.
SNAILS_ACT3_DESCEND_REPEAT : By the time the conversation ends, it's old news. You must go. No matter what you think, time is against you.
MAPPER_MASTER_ITEM : Thank you for sharing this moment with us. I give you a gift, a gift I never thought I could give you. You will gain the knowledge to create this ring and many others. Crafted from our expert's many formulas, these rings will break even the most powerful weapons in the world. Use them and forget them! Thank you, Shakra. I am so grateful that these tools were created by your expert. They will be invaluable on my journey.
HUNTER_FAN_SKULLKING_REPEAT : The warmth of this cave keeps its fragrance intact. For those who are constantly seeking knowledge, this is a true gift!
SHERMA_CITADEL_SPA_NOENCLAVE : Little strangers, these baths protect you from outside dangers, but be careful. You know how long spirits have occupied this palace. Ah... I must have lost some of my brothers. But isn't it said that they get lost in the end? Yes... the palace gives them its blessing. We are in the Holy Land, and it is a lovely house, as well as a lovely bath!
SPRINTMASTER_ACCEPT_SHORT : Peace! Our fantastic Shell Conflict is back!
GRINDLE_SLAB_MEET : Hello! If you thought a bandit named Bong-Bong was coming, he was just a worm! So, what are you doing here? Are they forcing you to steal? Greed, greed! I don't steal. I think the palace guards are thieves. The cage they locked me in had the same inscription as the one that brought me here. It would be a great gift to lock me in this cage and send me to my master. Hmm, jail is not good for you. I know you are a thief! You will be embarrassed here. The guards will soon try to bring you back to the cage! I'll give you that chance. I will pack my things and leave this sad place immediately.
MAPPER_SPAR_DEFEAT : Good, quick. The stamps on my ring are disappearing because of the weapons. When you are ready, we will fight again.
MRMUSH_LOC4 : ...Yes, communication is important. No matter how much they praise, no matter how much they whisper, everything has a meaning... ...Just like you said. Even flowers have a story. The light can be directed anywhere... Message, I don't want to disturb your meditation, but if you are listening I want to know... Write everything down and put it up. I am sure you will enjoy it. Perhaps this journey will lead you to the Garou…
HUNTER_FAN_COMPLETION_RESULT_2 : Wow, these scrolls are so beautiful! Do they tire easily? Bai, follow your prey. No sleep!
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_ENTRY_MEET : We made a legend with grace... with a sword.
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_LAKE_REPEAT : I spend my free time simply and happily.
MAPPER_DUSTPENS_BROKENBENCH : You know the palace's years would collapse in an instant! Its existence is a bitter cry. Maybe years are not flexible. Even if they exploded, the noise would soon stop and this place would be perfect. Quiet or not, I just want to stop this noise!
MAPPER_GENERIC_SHELLWOOD : These tracks, tied to the roots, tell the story of the master's tracks. Three dented insects, ugly wood, even sharp claws. There is a small sign that only I can recognize. Although the road is cold, I take comfort in knowing that the Lord is still alive in this world.
GILLY_INTRODUCE : As a teenager, these fields were dangerous. It was not a place to roam freely. where am i going A dangerous adventure! But to whom? He followed in his father's footsteps and explored these great caves. Although the surrounding land has crumbled to dust, there are still traces of life and growth in these fields. There is a living harmony here, in stark contrast to the gray soil and scattered dry marshes that surround it. Only time and research will reveal the reason.
MAPPER_ITEM_TOOL_COMPASS_DESC : You will find yourself at this turn in the land of the live circus. Any of the three can make one. I'll give you mine for a small fee.
HUNTER_FAN_COMPLETION_RESULT_1 : Oh my! Little Nuo didn't know there were so many wonderful things in Palo! Soft, big, small, big! Nuo wants everything left!
SHERMA_CORAL_NOBENCH : Red Maiden, do you see this statue? I've seen something similar before. It is often used as a symbol of our pilgrimage. When we sing, a miracle worker appears from the earth and offers us a place to rest. How wonderful! Don't sing, but pray the rosary brings this temple to life. Life without prayer is a mystical state. I have found similar structures on the road to Faro. This area is not peaceful.
MAPPER_ITEM_MARKER_E_DESC : You can use them to jot down important points and comments on a piece of paper. Made from the shell of an old tower clock, this tool is difficult but worth it.
SHAKRA_AID_MEET_FORUM : Pushanka! We are twisted above this iron structure. I sense an aggressive enemy. You also seem to have reached the end of the road. My mission is accomplished. They cry war. Are you going to join the attack of crazy killer whales?
SHERMA_HEALER_REPEAT : Do not all these wonderful cures testify to the sanctity of the palace?
SHERMA_RESCUE_MEET1 : Hello, red maiden! Fear not, it's me, Sharma! I found a cure, but the way was gone... I heard a groan in the dark... Oh, how glad I am to meet you!
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_CRAWL_NAME : Map of worm tunnels
SHAKRA_AID_REPEAT : Will we fight together and in a positive way?
SHERMA_CORAL_REPEAT : A large castle is now near us. We can hear the voices of our strangers.
GILLY_MEET_HUNTERCAMP : A formidable warrior, what a fight! You were the first to challenge the red snails and emerge victorious. They seemed formidable opponents and very skilled hunters. You hid from them. Don't hide too much, young man. isn't it me Camouflage and military skills are proven skills for me. These are the tasks that will be assigned to me!
GARMOND_MOORWING_INFORM : Be careful when you tread these dark lands. A huge winged beast roams the land, ready to kill unwary travelers! I think I saw the creature I spoke of. Maybe it accidentally followed me through the deserted streets. what is happening Grandma! A monster has been found! After Jaja rests, we begin the quest!
SHERMA_HEALER_MEET : Look back, Red Maiden. Thank you again for your help. I am no doctor, but thanks to the abilities of the lower barrier, even green nails can ease the suffering of my brothers. Although the pilgrims fulfilled their promise to reach paradise, I still wonder how much darkness has engulfed such a sacred place. To be honest, I don't doubt it. But enlightenment does not come easily, nor does it happen overnight. For now, there is nothing else to do but commit.
SHERMA_ENCLAVE_MEET1 : Hmm...? Hi! I am so glad to see you here, young red maiden. You finally reach the top of the camp, surrounded by so many brothers... I am truly happy. I am very happy. A bit of a stranger, he seems to question your faith. Now that you've seen the broken reality of this place, what do you think?
COURIER_TALL_THANK_PT1 : Ah, I survived without injury! So who is this stranger in the strange armor? He calls himself a good boy! I'm Hornet, Phil. Bellhart wants you as a brother. He is waiting for you there. I'm sure you want to revive him. Great advice! Don't worry about him. Thanks for taking care of him and you, Mr. Hornet! I am happy!
DICE_PILGRIM_DEPLETED_REPEAT : Bro, I hope my card brings you luck in your new campaign. I hope my introduction will make things easier for me.
GILLY_HUNTERQUEEN_STATUE : Hello, old statue! Who knows what clues it holds? The carved claws create a unique pattern, unlike any other structure in this cave. Who deserves such a unique souvenir? It looks like a dancer and its technique is truly amazing. There must be more of this ant before the wind cracks its shell and brain.
HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_COMPLETE_2 : Damn... forbidden trick.
SHERMA_CITADEL_SPA_REPEAT : Holy water is incredibly hot and perfect for washing. It has an immediate calming effect. Try it! Hahaha!
GRINDLE_ITEM_ROSARY_MAGNET : Lago-doo, you have found a lucky treasure! You'll attract minutes that make a metallic sound when you hit them with your claws!
GARMOND_MEET_CITADEL_FIRST : Come forward! My comrades, let us rise above this waste land! I stand before the honorable Mr. Gaiman and my mighty friend Zaza. Zaza and I must cross this castle and overcome the fear within us! Greetings! I am glad to have found a man of indomitable spirit and indomitable courage, who can withstand countless weapons. Ah! These supernatural enemies are infinite! This castle seems to be a source of heresy. We must fight for honor until we destroy the source of corruption!
SNAILS_ACT3_SHAMAN_CREST : We found the well in the secretary's room. The rest of the power has been given to us. Have we imposed a new nature on ourselves? And from the corpses of the ancestors who came to these lands as they are today? You seem easy. So much knowledge, so much power wrapped in silk. You were once called a thief. Your looting has been ruthless, but if you continue, everything will quickly fall apart. If your actions contribute to the safety of these caves, you have a right to claim.
MAPPER_BELLHART_REPEAT_ACT3 : Bomblebee, your trip will be short. If we don't do this soon, the world is dying. If we don't relieve soil stress, the other insects won't be able to do their jobs. Shakra, it is as you said. Let's do what we have to do.
HUNTER_FAN_HINT_GREYWARRIOR : At the edge of the world, swept by wind and sand, come and explore. One worm watched and waited. He was not afraid of their approach, fearing that if he raised it too high, Mucro would trap the ancient sword. According to his review, it would be better to look for a worm in tunnels deep in the bark, on the ledge. It would be hard to find, but be sure! With the strength of an adult, he knew he could reach them in an instant!
MAPPER_NOSTOCK_ACT3 : I have sold all the maps and equipment I used to provide my map data. I will not create more as long as this new threat persists. My card making is simple, but I hope that sharing my knowledge can make your life easier.
GARMOND_AID_READY : See you soon, sister! Me and Zaza will be with you soon!
SHERMA_BONEGATE_OPENED : Hello! Little Red Riding Hood, do you see that? The Great Gate heard my song and in its infinite and ancient mercy opened the way for us!
GARMOND_CITADEL_DEFEATED_REPEAT : Do we want to continue? Sure! We started right away. But I think Jaja still needs some work.
MAPPER_MEET_BONE_1A : Pushinka! Your knife is sharp, your senses are keen!
SNAILS_ACT3_TALK2 : Even knowing her reasons, it's a wonder the queen survived this long. No one can live in such a vacuum. She will wear the armor of a son, a veil. Even if she threw herself into the darkness, she would climb the thread. Her efforts will be rewarded and her soul will be comforted. But what else has she chosen? The holocaust is a dying god. If this rebellion continues, the kingdom will fall.
SNAILS_ACT3_TALK1 : Earthquake... This collapse will destroy all the lighthouses. Unless it destroys the void. You have probably noticed: the black thread weaves through your land. This darkness, woven from the silk of the fallen prince, lifts it up and swallows it deep. The roads to Faro were once dangerous. Now they are incapacitated. The pilgrims living in its land will have no choice but to help each other and hold on to hope. If this is of any use you must seek it out.
SHERMA_BONEGATE_MEET_2 : "What are you singing, idiot? It looks like there will be very few singers."
SHERMA_RESCUE_END2 : Are you coming to town safe and sound, boy? I will accompany you if necessary. Ah, good, Red Maiden. Now that the path is clear, I can find my guide. What is this new journey? Ha ha! Huh! You have something else. I felt it buried in this remnant of darkness. It shines blue and white. It looks beautiful ... it does not seem holy, but it brings honor!
SPRINTMASTER_HERO_WIN_POST : This is a challenge! It's broken! Everything will be fine. Good! Good! The real test is yet to come. Let's run away together again soon!
SETH_SHELLWOOD_REPEAT : I also learned that driving is dangerous. But I also discovered that I was pretty good at photography. It's amazing how accurately our instincts can guide us.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_BELLHART_NAME : Map of Belhart
MAPPER_SPAR_VICTORY : Anas... with great courage! Demonstrating the power of your weapon in a given battle is invaluable. If you have time, I would like to challenge you to a duel.
GARMOND_GRAND_FORUM : Ho-ho, sister, your beard is still shaking! That's when I realized it was going to be a terrible fight! Go first, Zaza, I'll keep you here, then I'll go.
SHERMA_CARETAKER_MEET_A : Hello, Red Maiden. It seems that I granted your wish and woke you up safe and sound. Little Shrama? what happened
MAPPER_CALLED : Pushanka! I found my ring, "The Boy with the Needle". The sound of his gun can be clearly heard from the smallest metal ring. I will definitely join the search for its owner, but for now I still use it as a base. If you would like to make an appointment, please use this link to contact me.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_WILDS_NAME : Long-term geographic map
SHAKRA_AID_ACCEPT : Shakra, your help is valuable. Let's go to the heart of this cursed camp. Garlock! Tempera arrow of the wasp. We will celebrate and give you a ring!
G_PRINCE_SONG_MEET : I never wanted to walk that hellish corridor again, but here I am, just like those old insects. Big mistake, you've come a long way from this dank prison. If you dare to call this a fortress, I salute you. Hmm. Then you are not entitled to that privilege, warrior. Not willing to resist it. The mind is weaker under the heavy pressure of the golden shoe, which determines its limits.
GARMOND_CITADEL_MEET : And now, brave sister! How we stand on top of this huge fairy castle! The animals, the monsters and all who live here have perished in that horror! And from this golden corpse emanates a curse that benefits earthly insects. Not to mention! Brave, beware. The enemy is a being far more destructive than any animal. Your soul will not be in vain. Hmm! Aren't we wise? We'd rather end our reign by devouring a hundred lives!
GILLY_MEET_HIDDEN : Ah! What a shame! To think that even a perfect mask can break! Oh, what a mistake! You are obsessed! It's not so bad, young man. Your outfit is almost done. I have lived with such care for so long. Ah! So I hope you don't have such sharp eyes when you look at these creatures. If they could break or swallow, your job would be much more difficult!
SHERMA_PILGRIMSREST_REPEAT : Sister, you are tired and sad, let's sing, sing, conquer together!
SNAILS_ACT3_DEEP_MEMORY1 : Ah! Escape the abyss unscathed! Was I afraid of this space? It's worse. The prince dragged me deeper into the pit. Deeper than I thought. To save the lighthouse, you must focus on the floating water beneath the surface. Ancients, survivors, even your shells sink into this void. You definitely cannot survive without help. Help is available. A flower that tolerates the dark. Do you know about this relationship?... I have heard the story, but I thought it was a myth. If it grew in the countryside I'm sure of it. I'm not looking here. Losing power is necessary, but it cannot last long. I want to immerse myself in its memory. Oh, oh, oh! So are we ready to tear out our souls to bring this legendary flower back to life? are we ready This would be impossible with other insects, but as a weaver I had the power to withstand it. I came across this flower for the first time once. I still vaguely remember what happened next. If I weave a flower in silk, I can be real. Ah! So you want a new idea from us? To make the flower shine brighter? ... But to illuminate the ancient memories of our race with such power... is not easy even for us.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_HUNTERSNEST_NAME : Map of predators
G_PRINCE_DANCERS_REPEAT : my will is true...
MAPPER_CURSED : Galatians! Pinhead, what has made you so sick? You are suffering from the effects of the parasitic cycle. There is an innate strength within you. It doesn't kill me, at least not yet. But the shell has cracked badly. Your pain is terrible. Run away or seek help immediately. I do not want you to succumb to such illusory powers.
SPRINTMASTER_ACCEPT_RETRY : Peace! Our fantastic Shell Conflict is back!
GRINDLE_ITEM_TOOL_KIT : You've always had a passion for experimenting and building traps, haven't you? You can make this set even more disturbing, hahaha…
MAPPER_GENERIC_BELLHART : Pushanka, the girl, has a needle. This land has been freed from the curse. Tell me, did your sword save him? If anyone here had done the same I would have been deeply moved. I killed the creature above the castle. The other was a weaver, but of his own free will he became entangled in a vine. With voice and claw he aided or directed the threads that fell upon the village. A weaver? Terrible, ancient creatures! We told the stories to the young people but they thought the body was tied with a needle. He was still alive, but the weaver was seriously contaminated. His silk is twisted and deeply inscribed on the shell. It was the cruelest punishment ever. Even though it's broken, I still envy it. The great skill of the weaver... In his mouth in war lies great challenge and the glory of victory.
MAPPER_GENERIC_GREYMOOR : These chakras: In the dim light of this damp cave, you must be seen. My son, your face is always lit by flying wings. The respect will never diminish. Heed the warning. Many wild animals breed nearby. In the water beyond the cave, in the hollow tree of old Mizoka, lives a horde of weary insects. They are expert pilots and dangerous. Their wings are always imprinted on my spine. If you look for a safe way, go back to the center of the earth.
HUNTER_FAN_ZAPNEST_REPEAT : Keep a safe distance from the beach.
SHERMA_CARETAKER_DELIVERY : Sharmaji, I brought supplies from the village below. I leave this to you, because you have done so much for us. Wow, thank you very much! This will surely give hope to our poor brothers.
SHERMA_CARETAKER_FINAL : Red Maiden, do you have an important job? If so, I fear the time of our separation is at hand. Sharma, you must know this. I will soon descend into the dark realm and suppress the source of discord in Farra. If I complete this mission, I will be far away from Farram. I still believe you can capture these pests and keep us safe. Ah! No, I'm still a fool, but I appreciate your faith. This warmth will give you the strength to face all the challenges ahead! Dear best friend, we are praying for you now. My hope will be with you until the end of darkness and beyond!

SHAKRA_GRAND_FORUM_REPEAT : It's up to you to decide which side you take. See you soon.
MAPPER_MEET_GUARD_ACT3 : Sakura, have you fought the Black Death? Even the most skilled warriors are dangerous. I understand the risk and don't have much of a choice. This monster flies and grows stronger in this village... Invalid bugs of this world, enclosed in a shell. I know well its power, its essence. If I could find its soul, I would gladly go there. Just like you said! They have collected many bugs in the bell. As long as this dark threat lasts, there is no other safe place. I certainly have the ability to capture what remains and protect it with my ring. Sakura, I want to put an end to this new disaster. It is a matter of great concern. It takes all my time. Björn. This village and bugs need protection. Nothing else. Well, hornbills and eagles. Protected card. If I try to end the poison, I will fight with repeated determination.
SHAKRA_AID_READY : Attack! Our rings will echo silently under the enemy fire.
HUNTER_FAN_FINAL_2 : And now, as an adult, your mission is accomplished! There is nothing more to do. But don't panic! Think! It is a small country. Rich in animals, smells and tastes, you discover many hidden places. No, the trip hasn't started yet. And to you, now an adult, I wish you success in your search and success in the future!
MAPPER_MEET_BELLHART_ACT3 : Sakura, what? How did such a crowd gather in such a desert? Dark alleys line the streets. I have managed to stop the new waves countless times, but they are filled with evil forces, and every time I tire... This is the void that surrounds this world and its cloak. I know well its power, its essence. When I feel its soul, desire draws me. Just like you said! All the gathered streets rang like a bell... But with this dark threat looming in the air, no place is safe, not even here. Sakura, I want to put an end to this new disaster. I also feel very anxious. It takes all my time. Until then, be patient. These streets and alleys need guarding. There are none. Well done, Wasp Wild Idol. He nodded. If you try to remove the poison, I will fight with renewed determination.
GRINDLE_BONEFOREST_FINAL : Sorry! Is it hot in here? Is it humid? These rich herbs seem to have been here for a long time. Isn't it wonderful to go where the treasure is hidden?
MAPPER_ITEM_MARKER_D_NAME : A title of darkness
SPRINTMASTER_HERO_WIN_PRE_1 : Is it a sin? Is that possible? Hmm... How fast you are! Miracle of Paruma! Follow me back. Even though you took the easy way out, you have shown incredible skill. Accept, O sage, this small reward. And don't forget about our great competition!
SHERMA_BELLHART_WAKE : Oh! I think I fell asleep as soon as I got here! Traveling is exhausting, but relaxation has its benefits.
MAPPER_GENERIC_HUNTERSNEST : Ah, restless girl. Your teacher would be proud of you. The one who taught me once... I never called him "teacher". I don't know if he's proud of me now. Nohakata! Even if he is dead, treat him as if he were alive! What the student does cannot go unnoticed by the teacher!
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_GREYMOOR_DESC : A large house covered in dust and shrouded in mystery. It seems that the insects that once lived here are long gone.
SHERMA_CITADEL_ENTRANCE_MEET : Red Maiden! My brother! Our great trip is finally over! Our faith is steadfast, and now our reward is bright: a shining fortress! A place where we can all sing together! I don't want you to look back, because I don't know you. But I beg you, stranger, be careful, for something terrible lurks in this castle. O brother! There is no need for caution or fear. With faith in the leader, let's go together!
MAPPER_GENERIC_BELLHART_TALK2 : This gold secures my castle. It seems that it once gave peace to insects for a long time. But look how many there are today. Very few remain under this cursed thread. Oh, my son, you have bent the needle; we must learn from them. Fred is a powerful poison that kills even the strongest insects.
MAPPER_GENERIC_BELLHART_TALK1 : Shakra, the camp looks beautiful. Are you planning to stay longer? Maybe. This spiritual decline is not only an ideal, but also the future, if necessary. But! Don't rest too much or your body will weaken and your senses will become dull.
SETH_SHELLWOOD_MEET : Hi, hello again! It's about time! I am so glad that we can meet in this silent forest. Do you have a name like mine? am i sure Crab: Look at the jewels above your head... Remember, I wondered? What? Of course not. But you are so beautiful! Maybe I'll catch up before I go.
MAPPER_ITEM_MARKER_A_DESC : Use it to mark main characters and characters on your map. I decided to highlight it to mimic the glow of my gland. It will remind you of me when you use it.
MAPPER_GENERIC_CRAWL_REPEAT : Pilgrims once traveled this road, but today it is inhabited only by hungry insects.
SPRINTMASTER_REOFFER : Hello Mr. Bagile! Have you changed your mind? Let's find our goals together!
MAPPER_STOCKDEPLETED : I still need some related information to fill out. Okay, we'll talk about it at the next meeting.
GRINDLE_RUMMAGE_REPEAT : Don't stay up late! I complain about you, but I don't talk to you!
MAPPER_GENERIC_DUSTPENS_REPEAT : Be careful: the deeper you go into the cave, the thicker the old air becomes.
SHERMA_BELLHART_REPEAT : I'll leave you right now. One last trip through the forest and once you've crossed the pass, you'll finally reach the castle. Who catches Damon first? If I can, I'll wait until we're both ready to climb!
SHAKRA_AID_REFUSE : If you are fighting alone, you don't say anything.
GARMOND_ENCLAVE : Soldiers, it's an honor to see you. It seems that this work has brought you peace. Who would believe that, brother? The accursed crown of the Light hides that salvation! We have conquered our beautiful village, but we use these spears against them! He was silent for a while, of course. Gaiman, you are doing well in your new job. I want to know if you have thought of saving these creatures and if this curse will be broken soon.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_DUSTPENS_NAME : Roadmap for Papyrus
GRINDLE_BONEFOREST_S1 : Oh my god, my god! You escaped Grindel's pocket! I have a secret and you won't soon forget it... lots of delicious food! But in this cave there is a big door... locked. If you go in, there's a lot of food waiting for you to come out!
SHERMA_CORAL_NOBENCH_ALT : Red Maiden, do you see this statue? I have experienced something similar before. The pilgrimage route is marked by reverence. When I sing, a miracle rises from the earth and a seat of peace approaches me. How wonderful! Maybe not a song, but a rosary, what this temple plays. I found a somewhat similar structure. It seems that peace does not come easily in this area.
GRINDLE_BONEFOREST_S3 : Ah! In Grindel's pocket! But the memory of our secret... Well, nothing compares to what he's hiding from us. This place is called the Castle. A golden land, full of treasures. Not even a thousand criminals combined could steal it all! Oh yes, Grindel is going there! But don't do this to us! We want to keep it all to ourselves!
GRINDLE_BONEFOREST_S2 : Oh, oh, oh! In a green baby bag! And don't forget the secret... Is it near the old chapel? There's also a big, dirty grave behind the chapel! Is it really a shell? Oh, oh, oh! My nose tells me there is something precious there.
SNAILS_ACT3_MEET_END_VISITED : Besides the bone cave, I am still alive in the courtyard. I see ships passing under it and a heavy watch underwater. All I need is access and carrier support. I will locate the courtyard so I can find a way to get there. For the first time in centuries, such depths have been hidden. Even our nation has long overlooked this burden. Our preparation is far more thorough than anyone else's. We must dig deeper into this country and uncover the truth about this new tragedy that we have created together.
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_UNFINISHED_REPEAT : Why is it disappearing? Why not remember this sacred place?
LACE_ABYSS_LAKE_1 : Sit here, sir. You live too high. Can't you darken your land, your only salvation?
GARMOND_EXPLORING_ACT1_REPEAT : Gaiman, be careful. Whatever threatens these lands will be more terrible than what remains in this castle. Oh, brother! Zaza and I will not fall until this castle and justice is served.
LACE_ABYSS_LAKE_3 : Spider, I rose to keep you alive. I gave your mother a silk grant. i won The mother sees my son tired, weak and weak, mortally wounded. Enjoy! And it has been done. I don't want to do this. I was the protector of a dying nation. This operation... cannot be repeated. As long as I live and have the strength to survive, this kingdom and the ants that nest in it will not perish.
LACE_ABYSS_LAKE_4 : Hahaha! Spider Spider. Great example! Even if the world collapses you would fight. That would turn your secret and your rope to dust and you would use your sword in vain... Maybe there is a way to avoid this fate. I want to find a flower with a hidden power to banish the darkness. These snails are also guilty of the sin of laying cobwebs and emptying them carelessly. Now they have healing together. My son, when the time comes to harness this mysterious power and free this land from your mother's rule, I will return.
GRINDLE_SHOP_REPEAT : Craving something delicious? We will never back away from fair trade, haha! Don't forget to check out our premium products...
GRINDLE_ITEM_TOOL_POCKET : You can create a small pocket in the dash to store extras, even sharpies!
MAPPER_TUBE : Shakra, if you don't mind, I would like to teach you my art of carving. I've discovered a new mode of transport in Castle Square: a network of tubes carrying shuttles and airships. The castle is a maze and it would be helpful to mark each station with a nail. What you have described seems ugly and artificial, just like the structure itself. But if you find something useful, fix it. We will get back to you soon. Let's install it and replace it with a new nail.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_MOSSGROTTO_DESC : This cave bed poses no particular danger to experienced warriors and can be used for meditation.
SHERMA_CORAL_NOBENCH_REPEAT : Fear not, Red Maiden! This temple will surely be built for us. All we can do is pray patiently!
SNAILS_ACT3_HEART_HINT_SHELLWOOD : Deep in the forest, hidden among the roots, bushes and branches, you will find the first sower. It is the core of the earth, it is the core of everything. An insect cannot see, yet it is so powerful. I have heard that a castle was once full of noise, but they sent an ambassador to build a temple as a sign of their honor with the demon. Maybe it's worth a look?
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_DUSTPENS_DESC : The old streets and alleys are covered in filth and full of cockroaches and children.
MAPPER_NOSTOCK : There are more people to buy. Maybe when they meet again on the street we will sell something new.
GRINDLE_ITEM_PSALM_CYLINDER : What do you think of the brilliant fidget spinner that is taking the big city by storm? That's great!
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_BONEFOREST_NAME : Bone marrow map
MAPPER_ITEM_MARKER_D_DESC : It can be used to create large landmarks and waypoints on maps. This dark, bark-like substance is more comfortable to the touch and more durable than it looks.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_BONEFOREST_DESC : A broken road built on the shell of an old scarab. The entire city of Parus is built on this fragile foundation.
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_CORALCAVERNS_DESC : Gradually, a layer of soil has risen, remaining from the time when the great warriors invaded these lands, but much of it is submerged in water.
MAPPER_MENTOR_MEET : Shakra, you search these lands so carefully... Who are you looking for? Osedina... What a serious question! Go to my master, the noblest member of our family. I have followed him all over the kingdom, but I have yet to find any trace of him. He has been wandering for a long time, but if I continue the path and stay awake, we will surely meet again.
MAPPER_GENERIC_SHADOW_REPEAT : The stone buildings here remind of a time when clean water flowed here. What a wonderful sight! Even the swamp dwellers seem to have been born poisoned by nature.
SHERMA_BONEGATE_MEET_3 : But look! As we walk our sacred path, temptations await us. This huge gate blocks our way. Only prayer and song can open the way! In this world, music touches even the strongest bones!
DICE_PILGRIM_DEPLETED : I won again! I've never had this much luck before... That was wrong, mate. Winning this game is a matter of skill. Don't rely on luck alone. Hmm. I am a brother in the same situation. But there is one thing I must admit. Actually I lost my last bet. I can't even pay it off. At least I can give you a hint: it's a gamble. I think you will like them. Like him, he needs chocolate.
LACE_ABYSS_LAKE_DIVE_2 : Who is waiting there to find Mr. Spider? A sick child or a dying animal? So I'll confuse you. I don't expect you to be there.
GRINDLE_BONEFOREST_INTRO : Hi, are you still here? Keep calm here. You have to hide. Do you know how to use this toy car? Is CoroCoro a game? Do you want to go back to the toy store?
MAPPER_ITEM_MARKER_A_NAME : Shell marks
G_PRINCE_DANCERS_MEET : There you are. Who inspired you? I am not a warrior. This place fills me with so much boredom... The dancers... they were the last bastion of freedom... He sacrificed everything in a desperate attempt to save the cave. His shell and his soul changed. I did not dare to meet him for a long time. Even if our lands are bound only by stars and ruins... Rest in peace, great insect. His soul is now stripped of its iron shell, and with the calamities of your country this stronghold has been completely dismantled. Ah... some relief, warrior, now is all he cared about.
SNAILS_ACT3_CLOVER_HEART : what is this You have an ancient object, an unexpected heart... the heart of a noble king. In this cave I once saw happy kingdoms. A wonderful sight to behold. Strange. All is lost... to the Blue King.
DICE_PILGRIM_NOTENOUGH : Rosaries are our favorite brand. If we collect enough, we keep them.
SPRINTMASTER_EXTRA_MEET : Agile Bug, you're back! You're just in time. Are you ready for a new challenge? The route is the same as last time, but the distance and the number of slides have been slightly increased. Will it test your patience? I have tried several times. Excellent! Excellent! But remember that the prizes in this category are very limited. What are you doing, Agile Bug? Let's go!
MAPPER_SPAR_DECLINE : And again Shakra. I have always been passionate about science, now I need a job. "And Zoro!" Come on, pick up the phone. My ring is waiting for you.
GARMOND_MEET_ACT1 : Bird! Brothers in arms, if you take up arms, you will meet the honorable soldier Gamondius and the brave Count Zaza. Together we will face any challenge! I will not fight you, worm. How nice to meet an ordinary person like this, a person with an unwavering determination to resist the curse. Ah! How many such heavenly enemies there are! Typhis' preferred place in the waste fields of Pharus. Ah, we see so much violence and corruption. I fear that a curse will fall upon this whole kingdom.
MAPPER_MEET_BRIEF : Pusanka! A sharp sword and a sharp mind! This is how soldiers are received in our countries. You were born, but you are already a warrior. Your posture, weapon, your direction: everything is self-explanatory. I am the navigator of this tribe and I drew a map of this land. If you want, we can exchange maps and articles.
MAPPER_GENERIC_BELLHART_REPEAT : Still have stuff to swap?
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_GREYMOOR_NAME : Grimoire card
HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_REPEAT : Hey, if you want to learn more about the creatures of this earth, why don't you go fishing yourself? Mother? Fishing? That's ridiculous! Hunting is not the instinct of the priesthood. Nature is learned. Sure! But you... You're a hunter! You are a good pastor; you can tell by the smell! That's why I asked you to cut it out and write it down. So we can both learn something!
SHERMA_CITADEL_SPA_ENCLAVE : A short journey, this would be a small oasis of peace, with no added danger. A village has sprung up around the ancient temple. This awakening feels like a refuge, a safe haven from the dangers within. The pilgrims nearby will be happy to have you with them. Oh, how wonderful! So I leave shortly after a few baths. I want to leave this holy place clean and renewed!
MAPPER_QUILL : Hi friend, you have so many photos. Maybe you should trade pens for pens. This will improve your maps as you go. With enough knowledge, you will eventually know everything about this world.
MAPPER_GENERIC_BELLHART_ALT : Pushanka! Needle girl. You also opened this place to similar beings. I have waited so long for this moment and I am amazed. Now I am here, free, and some villagers invite me to shop and welcome me. I killed a giant creature that ruled the city. I thought it was a weaver, but my intention was weak. I guessed right. Despite its age, it had a ferocious power. With her voice and claws she held and arranged the cursed threads that held this land together. Weavers? Terrible creatures. We told the children their stories, but they were long dead, their bodies tied up with needles. This one is still alive, but even its tentacles are brutally torn. His silk is wound high, tightly bound in chains. It was a cruel punishment unlike anything I have ever seen. It's broken, my envy remains. The great skill of the Weaver... For the Weaver in battle is the great test and the glory of victory.
MAPPER_GENERIC_BONEBOTTOM : This station, no doubt inhabited by foreigners... Dundok! where are the weapons A mirror? I have never seen such comfortable ramparts! The pilgrims here have no intention of fighting, Shakra. Many will head to the castle as soon as they arrive. Hmm. If they are not careful, their only hope in a hostile land is death.
LACE_CITADEL_MEET : what is this A very tall, small spider trembles before the great palace. Blue and white boy, are you finally back to laughing at me? Neither you nor my country have won my praise. This dormitory is no exception. My spider, why are you so sad? You can't even imagine the power that remains there, that can destroy hope in an instant. Stupid child. Do you think I don't know your master yet? Do you see the splendor of this land, the loyalty of the animals that live there, and the curse that falls upon them? The signs are clear. Your kingdom has fallen to a greater insectoid. Whatever this creature asks for the silk and the shell, know that I love them both dearly.
SHERMA_CORAL_JUDGE : Aren't these tough judges amazed? They neither speak nor sing, but I sense immense wisdom in their shining eyes! Be careful, little one. Wise or not, judgments are often followed by violence. Many fellow pilgrims have fallen on these hills. What?... But sometimes even the fallen rise again and the journey is over? I heard!
MAPPER_GENERIC_HUNTERSNEST_REPEAT : The tunnel hides many powerful enemies and numerous traps. Proceed with caution!
MAPPER_ITEM_TUBE_PIN_DESC : If desired, this letter can be turned into a label indicating the base of motion of the ugly steel and steam building.
COURIER_TALL_THANK_PT2 : Go, Belhart, bring me back! I will never walk this earth without my sharp claws. Ah! You heard right! I ran to Belhart and my brother. Anyone passing by, come say hello!
MAPPER_MENTOR : "Chakra, who are you calling?" a voice came from the cave. We went to the depths of Parus and searched for our lady, the supreme goddess of the nation. But our trail did not reach us and her identity was lost. I must come a long way, but if I am steadfast and watchful, we shall surely meet again.
MAPPER_SPAR_REOFFER : It never softens the skin. Otherwise they pounce on her with the point of a sharp spear. Why doesn't the leper see me with a needle in my hand? Come, let's sharpen our skills together.
GILLY_CARMELITA_CORPSE_REPEAT : I wish you all the best in your great work. But I am sorry to have suffered and paid a cruel price.
GRINDLE_TRAPPED2 : Hurry up, let's go! I want to go to certain places, I want to see certain insects, I want to love certain things!
GREEN_PRINCE_CLOVER_MEET_1 : Warrior... I heard your footsteps. why have you come Don't you want to see this lost cave? The road was easy. He had just left. You must have guessed that you once lived in this distant land, right? Ah... and you flaunted your majesty. The end of the lighthouse is near, but my cave, this cave, is long gone. I am the last survivor in this wonderful land...
HUNTER_FAN_ZAPNEST_SLAP1 : "You're an old lady who's almost always fishing," you thought. Maybe she has animal feces in her body? Let's clean them out and let them grow with soft cotton!
LACE_MEET_4 : This is so delicious! Now I love it!
SNAILS_ACT3_DEEP_MEMORY2 : Fate has done its job. Great strength, great power, perhaps equal to this prince... Even if my power were enough, I cannot give it to you. I still need my strength to face him there. Where else do you find its origin? In Forum! Ho-ho-ho! Our kingdom is a kingdom where true desires are manifested. The lighthouse was not born of this ancient prince. There was power in this land before he bound you, legion. You will find the ancients in the bosom of the kingdoms and the heirs of the supreme power. They are still hiding somewhere, dying in the long cold of the Empire. You have to wake them up. Play a sad, salty song, search their memory and teach them to live again.
GRINDLE_CITADEL_SLAP_2 : My goodness, what an event! Avoid the curse!
GRINDLE_BONEFOREST_OFFER : My God, my God! Fill your pockets with these powerful sounds. Then I will reveal the most important secret!
HUNTER_FAN_HINT_WISP : When you grow up, you go on a hunt to climb the tallest tower. A new worm hides in the dense forest and emits dancing flames. How beautiful! How hot! But when someone tries to block it, the flames on the surrounding surface grow and explode. Dear deer, now is a real miracle! As an adult, you and the deer are in your hands. Climb up and put out the fires. You have to do it in our magazine.
MAPPER_GENERIC_JUDGESTEPS : Pushkin! Trembling children, have you seen the mark of our master here? I believe he died recently! I'm not sure, but if Chakra was looking for an unarmed enemy, those features would be available. The soldiers guarding them are cruel. Absolutely! They fight like fierce defenders and refuse to give up the fight. In fact, it forces them to brutally use the weapons of the barbarians.
MAPPER_MASTER_MEET : Pushanka, who controls the sound in the horn. is that your name I heard them cry in awe of these lands. I was hoping you would answer the call. One is good these days, but two is better. A powerhouse, I won't deny that I crave it. There seemed to be a big ceremony at the end of this trip, but alas, my thoughts were right. Is this your master? This is the most feared place of our species. True, I called her a woman, but she was more than just an animal that gave birth to me. Among the countless wonders of this world, she found a worthy end. Death of old age... my species would consider it shameful, but I see no strength in it. Though her arms failed her, she has walked to the end of this world. I would consider it an honor to accompany her. Crabro, magical artist, you have walked many paths like us. Now let's sing her song. It's time to lay down your arms...
MAPPER_GENERIC_BONEBOTTOM_REPEAT : From this point on, you can safely wear your glasses while you work. This barrier is vulnerable and dangerous. Remove the arms.
SETH_FESTIVAL_REPEAT : Have you ever played ice hockey? It's fun, right? Want to play again and see if you can get a better score than this?
LACE_TOWER_DEFEAT_2 : Is this what he wants from you?
SPRINTMASTER_ACCEPT : Calm down! YES! Our wonderful battle is about to begin. One more thing, agile animal! If you get lost, want to hurry or just want to make some noise, my partner will follow you to the starting line. Quick! Interactive tour. Give us time to think about the right way to test our skills.
SHERMA_RESCUE_MEET2 : Remember to be grateful. The living dead live on.
SNAILS_ACT3_HORNET_MEMORY1 : Flamini, the time has come. You have found the heart of the sheep as you asked. Is playing the song enough? Ah, I'm ready. But sir, few people know that you have power and everything is burning to save the motherland. I warn you, old man, this is not a fun move. But we will stay with you as long as necessary. Then we will prepare. Sleep on the platform and leave.
MAPPER_GENERIC_PEAK_REPEAT : It will not be easy to reach the height of this magnificent mountain. I'm only looking at the basics. The Guru said, "I will return and try to reach the summit."
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_CRAWL_DESC : The caveman is a ferocious, unstable and dangerous insect. There are very few signs of strangers making their way down this narrow road.
GARMOND_CITADEL_DEFEATED : Solarium... The duel ends. I... SOLEA... forgive me for sneaking off. Oh, men, it was a fair fight. But now we have to move on. This place cannot rest for long. Yes, indeed. Our products never run out. We must always move forward. There was no time!
SPRINTMASTER_RETRY : Don't let that get you down, you little bastard! Accept the challenge. Let's dance together again!
GARMOND_TALK1_CITADEL : Gaiman, what was your goal when you first set foot in this castle? We have one goal: a sacred mission, my brother! A joint journey with our faithful companion, our beloved Ovo. Let's conquer this fortress. Let's challenge the leaders and demand answers, even by force if necessary! All for the good of our beloved castle, to which we dedicate our shells. A terrible curse has fallen upon our people. Over those who cling to our memory and await the day of their justice.
DICE_PILGRIM_MEET : Ah, strangers! Here I prayed alone. Only the wind fills my voice. Quickly. The tour is almost over. Only the last, most difficult part remains to be climbed. The Pilgrim's Fort is nearby. You are the strongest. So far, if any of your companions manage to do very little. Ah, the road is longer, and the higher you climb, the more sincere you feel. It took a lot of luck and unwavering faith to get this far. And above all, it is clear.
SPRINTMASTER_HERO_WIN_POST_LAST : "Wow... you did it! Damn it! I didn't believe the weapon was so powerful! I'm truly amazed! You predator, you proved it. You granted my wish, you defeated me, you defeated me, and you pushed me to the limit."
GARMOND_CITADEL_OFFER : It's all good! Sister, I have a great idea. Before we go any further, shall we test the weapons? Let's have some fun. Don't worry, fate won't hurt you!
GARMOND_FINAL : Forgive me, sir. This is the only way to free him from his bondage. Anyway... then let's go...
HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_COMPLETE_4 : Nu's true will comes. Have you gone wild hunting and recorded it in your journal? Of course. Their looks and demeanor are important in battle. You must record all of this. Yes, indeed! I hope it teaches you many new things! Come, woman, accept a gift to aid you in your quest! Ladies, I'm adding pockets to your gear so you can have plenty of gear on the hunt!
GRINDLE_ITEM_MASK_SHARD : Is it just part of the mask? Don't ask where the rest is... touch it yourself!
MAPPER_ITEM_MAP_PEAK_NAME : Map of fault mountains
HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_COMPLETE_1 : Who portrayed the countless creatures of Paris in your memoirs? Oh mother! Oh mother! Check out this amazing list of these amazing animals and insects! As a grown man you have butchered, crushed and painted so many creatures! The essence lingers within you, the fragrance mingled with your perfume! Oh mother!
GARMOND_GRAND_FORUM_REPEAT : Go first, Zaza, I will watch and take the dead.
HUNTER_FAN_JOURNAL_COMPLETE_3 : You know, given? It's nice to drink water from such a ferocious predator... but it's not good. It is hostile. And yet you want to see so many lovely animals... You did a great job, sad woman! I am so grateful!
MAPPER_GENERIC_BONE : We will soon leave this ruined road, but if you cross the road below we will meet again. There you may run into strangers.
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_STAG_MEET : Here are the green trails of the deer... We hunted and defeated him like no other... This was a sign of our greatness... This was a sign of holy power.
GRINDLE_ITEM_SPOOL_PIECE : It's a beautiful, shiny thing. It might also be a bit dangerous because it has a weird, scary, hissing smell. Look! Give me these pearls and my nails will shine!
GARMOND_CITADEL_ENEMYFIGHT : Hello, brother! We have won another great victory. Not even the accursed powers of the land will be able to resist our pure breasts!
SNAILS_ACT3_DEEP_MEMORY4 : Stay ahead of us. We must use all our power to preserve this country. We are too stressed. Even though we try to react vigorously, we don't want to be that tired. If the bullet and your companions remain intact, you'd better miraculously get off the field unscathed.
GARMOND_CITADEL_ACCEPT : Grandma! You have acted bravely, sister! Get your weapons ready!
HUNTER_FAN_FINAL_1 : Ah! My queen... Your diary is full of creatures of all kinds! So full! How wonderful! There must be something we can do! He says that the hunter's cunning made him so cruel! It's been a huge period in my life and I've learned so much by recording it. Even after leaving this state, we must continue. Oh mom, this hunger is worth it! My queen, we agree. We are both hunters. May it be our change, the hunger and so on! This Hagano is your witness, of all your efforts, a sign of your character. It has a unique fragrance, sweet and velvety!
GREEN_PRINCE_VERDANIA_ENTRY_REPEAT : Let's all bow down to our green prince...
GARMOND_TALK1 : Gmand, why do you cross this desert? Looking for a castle there? Ah! But don't mistake this brave man for a stranger. Our way is holy and we walk with our faithful companion, Zaza. We do not seek her patronage gifts. Not at all, my sister! We seek its leader. We seek answers! Even if we have to force them! To our beloved castle, who swore to give us the maps. Our beautiful people have been betrayed by a terrible curse... We are the only survivors, we hold their memory and our hope for justice high.
MAPPER_GENERIC_CRAWL : Hello Shakra. It's good to hear your voice echoing through the collapsed tunnels. How is the search for your husband going, Mr. Pushanka? It is difficult to follow him in this cave, because insects are constantly pushed into the rocks. But I see the man coming here. His steps are wonderful, his steps are strange... his intentions are strange. But that is not the point. Maybe he'll teach me something when they meet again. For now, I prefer to stay in the shadows.
GRINDLE_SAVED2 : How shameful it would be to keep you in such a place!
SHERMA_BELLBEAST_REPEAT : Come, beast, hear my voice! Sing with me, sing with me, sing, dance! My voice echoes in the caves, in the streets!

SNAILS_ACT3_HEART_HINT_ANT : You will find my cousin's last queen, the last plains to roam. Her presence is still felt... almost imperceptible. The young woman herself united the barbarian nations with her voice. She gave them the strength to resist the will of the Venetian king... at least more than many others could.
SHERMA_CITADEL_ENTRANCE_REPEAT : Come, brothers! Move forward with faith!
MAPPER_GENERIC_SHELLWOOD_RAPTURED : Sorry! Not far from there, in the heart of the ancient Mac des Cloches, I found a village. The insects were still there, in their silk nests. An invisible predator seemed like a terrible trap. I quickly left the area avoiding the flickering thread. I also betrayed that village. I had seen a soldier on the road, but here they attack freely. The curse on the village should be more severe. The cruel use of silk is reaching dangerous levels. If we are to stay on the path, we must seek its source.
SPRINTMASTER_REOFFER_FINAL : What do you say, little animal? We are expensive, but I would love to fly with you again!
GARMOND_GRAND_FORUM_ASLEEP : Seungrun, look Haha... Seungrun, look...
MAPPER_ROSARIES : Do you have enough gems to trade? Pilgrims still carry them from the deserts of nearby villages. Should we take the ones we need? It would be wrong to leave them alone forever.
GILLY_HUNTERTRAP_CAUGHT : Oh, what ingenious traps the red clams have set to protect their borders! It is amazing that they survived such a brutal attack. Their shell must be very thick!

MRMUSH_END : ... ... oh, I'm sorry.

MAPPER_GENERIC_SHADOW : Shakra, are you going to attack this egg too? The lighthouse spires welcome us with a loud roar. This is the Lord's will and we follow it. But you are right!

It is wise, sir, to be on your guard against those who lurk in the dark.

SNAILS_ACT3_MEET_END_NOTVISITED : Port Flame Lake still offers access to the lower reaches of the river. But you will be the first to come for ages. Then our path will be clear. Stay in the temple and await our return. If we can save these countries, you can still play an important role.
SPRINTMASTER_YESNO : Are you quick and agile?
GILLY_HUNTERTRAP : Oh, how magnificent these red-armored beasts are, ready to protect their lands! I myself once escaped a terrible disaster by one step. This just adds to the confusion...
SETH_FESTIVAL_MEMENTO : Beautiful! Excellent! In this great game you have to match or beat my score! It's amazing to see such amazing talent here. Beating your score wasn't easy, Seth, but you made it look easy. Thank you for the compliment! But he is still amazed by my skills. I don't remember many of my abilities anymore.

And with such a strong personality, I know I remember you!... No, sir. I think you are confusing me with someone else. You... travel, travel this trembling world, don't you? Of course! I was just born into this world. When I woke up in the pool, this was the only weapon I had left. My name is Seth, but I don't know who gave it to me. Maybe this is a new nation to explore the world? That's what I've decided to do! Let us rest here a little and continue our journey.
HUNTER_FAN_MEET_ACT3 : You have grown! What a surprise for Nu! The world trembles and the black thread grows. It is dangerous to walk now. But you! Have you grown? Have you grown? Are you ready to hunt where darkness covers you? I am not a child, my queen. Be honest! So you must fulfill your wish! To do that, find more amazing worms in Pharoma and collect them. Slash them with your sword! Cut them with a perfect heart! Cut them with a cruel heart. Will you help him before everything is destroyed? Can you recover his book and fill its pages with broken knowledge?

MAPPER_GENERIC_HUNTERSNEST_DEEP : Hello Shakra. I heard you were in this cave, among the war years. Pushanka! You did the right thing by trusting your intuition. The red armored warriors who opened this path are formidable foes. I want to spend time here trying to fight their swords and traps, but it's hard work. You too!
GARMOND_BLACK_THREAD_EXHAUSTED : Hard... iron, my sister. What a price to pay for this eternal struggle! When peace returns, we will be filled with gratitude... You carry heavy burdens. I sympathize with your desire to rid this country of its curse, but it is better to remain among the scum. Should we rest? While our beloved sister fights valiantly? Oh... drop it. What will this old villager think if we leave work? No, believe me, this old shell is still full of energy!

GARMOND_BLACK_THREAD_FIRST : Goodbye, brother. This living castle will eventually fall, but the lands beyond will rot!

MAPPER_ITEM_PIN_BENCH_NAME : Office staff
MAPPER_GENERIC_DUSTPENS : Needle boy. This is a well-trodden path, not at all suitable for soldiers like us. It is worth fighting the cockroaches and their guardians, but the air is cold and the water is full of insects. This environment is truly hostile, but these creatures have adapted to many challenges. Do you think your grandfather was here? At first I didn't think so, but upon closer inspection I saw part of the path that connects these eerie ruins. Maybe he saw something I didn't? His senses are acute where mine are dull.
GARMOND_AID_MEET_BEAST : Wait, sister! An incredible animal is roaming these lands. It beats and screams like a merciless tyrant! Jaja asks. It's definitely here! Quick! The longer the eyelashes are, the closer they are. An animal needs a strong man, right? Where are we going together?

But now, traveling through so many countries, how many amazing sights have I seen? A burning lake, a dense forest, a cave full of sand and snow... It's no surprise to anyone, but considering how quickly the void regenerates, you and I are the last to remember. Harold, I cannot forgive such an ending. Now I try to save this place for myself and the insects that still live here. After seeing so much, tell me the truth: do you think my efforts are in vain? Are they really? Of course you can, but I can't give you a fair answer. I don't care about the outcome. My vision is always disturbing now. It's just a journey... now. This is my purpose, this is the only purpose I strive for. If anyone still understands this world, it's probably Ben Willem... but not now, not yet. Huh? Will your work ever bring me back to life in the distant future? Ah, it is time to leave this horrible cave. Our paths may cross for a long time yet, but I hope you find much happiness along the way too.

Let me tell you! Where there are many, there is a sweet song!

But remember, the future will be yours, not the past. Your nature is stronger. For it is better to follow those who guide you than to fear the destruction of the kingdom. Oh, don't flatter me! But it is my friends who guide me. Even in these desperate times, they continue to sing.

Your country has not yet proven its worth to me. This sleeping palace does not welcome anyone. My spider, why are you so pitiful? You can't even imagine the power left for you, which can shatter your hope in a moment. Foolish child. Do you think I did not come here to rule this country, your kingdom? insect that dwell in it, and the curse that lies in them. The signs are clear: your kingdom is being conquered by a being of a higher order than an insect.

HUNTER_FAN_CORALDRILLERS_MEET : Hey, hey, woman! Have you come to see red creatures like Nova? I found a huge creature. New, but not new! Two creatures attack me and pierce the rock with spiral arms.

A worm cannot escape from a deep cave. Of course it can. But when we do, what's better? Huge, powerful creatures, far from the threat of Pharma.
