SLAB_PRISONER_REMEET : Ah... you came up with another song. Getting drunk, which would be unnecessary. If you are upset, you will not satisfy my curiosity. But I need to hear something. What did Kel do to put you in custody? Was it my fault? The fraud was serious and caused many people great pain. But if we're talking about sin... we don't want to talk about it anymore.

SONG_KNIGHT_OUTRO_1 : Yui just wants toâ€¦

Endure it! I just need to cook to wake up and please my boss. Come on! I'll give you a sign. I have brought with me a fragrant and delicious dish that even an intelligent apothecary will be pleased with!
GOURMAND_SERVANT_MEET_ACT3 : Huh? Oh, just bright red leather? I waited for a word from heaven to explain the meaning of that scream and horror. They have failed their sacred duty! God save them from this bitterness. Or their digestive systems will be disturbed. They are worse than rawness. You are safe. Luck has nothing to do with it. My nation today is stronger than these reluctant geese!

GOURMAND_SERVANT_NECTAR : If you're looking for a sweet drink, try vintage nectar. This rare and wonderfully flavorful liqueur is one of the most beloved. There is hardly any drink as old as this that is still around today. The rich aroma is an integral part of this divine dish!

SONG_KNIGHT_INTRO_2 : I wanted to answer your call as a friend, or at least a partner, but now, with you here, I can sense your intentions. Will you raise your sword against me? Am I your enemy?

Do you think I will suffer like a thread of blue and white silk? I believe you are wiser. My silk is mine and my will is my own. This guardian cannot be trusted. Not even in pure pain. Unfortunately, your will will be tested here.

LIBRARIAN_FIRST_RELIC_GOT : Ah! Ah! He gave us this. Now keep your word and help me with your vision. Such madness! He is looking for the grave guard. His thickness is deadly, unless he smells like a weaver's daughter. Do you know anything about the knowledge of my ancestors about worms? If you can serve me, I trust in your service. The beast! Death! That cruel man of yours is about to die. I think it's best to stay like this...survive. But the youngest. He bites his nails. The knowledge gained should be shared as often as possible. The sepulcher should only honor his firstborn son.

LIBRARIAN_QUEST : Keeper of the vault, I seek the song hidden in your covert. The prince belongs to the group. Tell me what you know. Should vibration steal the sacred song? We have suffered and thrived in such darkness... It would be shameful blasphemy to give it to strangers... They claim to have found the truth in the darkness. Something sweetly spoken within. Something comforting. If your father and his song stay low, I will always feel it.
LIBRARIAN_RELIC_GOT : Ah! O wonderful son of the weaver! The overseer of this ark will absorb the wisdom created by the Great Spirit.
COG_STATUE_CONDUCTOR_TALK_B : When we sing, our songs help us. May they lead us to eternal peace.

GOURMAND_SERVANT_CRUSTNUT : If you want to add some spice to this dish... use shrimp. Dozens of plants have been uprooted from the tops of the coral caves behind the wide entrance. They probably still grow there today, even in this sandy soil.
COG_STATUE_LIBRARIAN_TALK_B : As we sing, give us strength in our singing. We learn eternal peace.
COG_STATUE_LIBRARIAN_TALK_A : Listen to the voices of the guardians of this magnificent house. For centuries they have protected our history, our prayers and our secrets.
GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_EGG : Bruised in vinegar swamp! Is there still a recipe for cooking a refugee? No, your majesty. I removed the mass from the chef's body. Even after the cursed children's heads were stolen, the cruelty continued. Unbelievable! This faithful worm, lost in thought, still knew how to cook. This castle is too terrifying to harbor such a creature.
GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_ACCEPTED : what do you need Tell me the price and I'll find it for you. I have a useful oil for you. If you promise me a reward, I will take care of you. Hmm! The Holy Captain will not be pleased with such a tempting offer... Good... Good. Bring the ingredients, I'll make you a light masala!

I'm not crying; I am a guest in the palace. Tell me, is your oil bottle small? It has nothing to do with it, little one! This sacred repository and all its land belongs to the Almighty. Great job! The most beloved of all ages, a man of infinite taste! Like a faithful worm, and they alone will worship him before you. This oil is a little spice that will whet your appetite before a great meal begins. This magnificent marble nave has comforted me for centuries. Yet God above has forsaken my God! Besides, I'm quite old. It is what prevents you from collecting the necessary items. Stop being idle!
LIBRARIAN_TINKED_RETURN : How terrible! What madman would attack the guardian of the Holy Ark? He has wisdom and reason! He has no other in this decade of the season. Would death be enough? If so, the shock would be perfect!
TORMENTED_TROBBIO_DEFEAT : Destroy the barbarians! We have no such problems. We don't want to touch the lustful shell! Abstain from evil. We rally, we attack, we fight; the enemy is fate itself, rising in anger.

We must save and find! The power of understanding, comfort, peace. Now we have to deal with the burial. Me and survivors who help me. We can seek solutions in temples or chants, but they cannot soothe the unbearable pain.
LIBRARIAN_ALL_RELICS : Excellent! Look! The mouse shines with light. Divine wisdom is certain. Son of the weaver, you have done your work... the deal is sealed. Knowledge and heritage are passed on faithfully. Nothing is left between us. Leave your treasure and your wisdom to this guardian. He has served. Now this guardian wants to be left alone!

LIBRARIAN_MELODY_PLAY_PRE : The weaver's son fell and found it. We steal the Holy Book from the Dark Pope... Never! The Lord commands: we should not give our lives into the hands of serpents or guardians. But you, foolish weaver, easily tear down these inhabitants. The Pope is your traitor, condemn him. Your friends are the thread and the witness. The laws once observed perished with them. Ah! They have lost it! Pray for a holy song, and if we are both damned forever, how can we suffer!
LAST_CONDUCTOR_MEET_VAR : Give me, I will return to your song. I will bury it in my heart. Dear stranger, if your faith is so great, I will gladly give you a gift.
GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_REWARD : My husband looks very happy. It's time to publish the pledge. That's right! It's ready! He did it and served it. This is a perfect dish for my picky eater husband. Take it easy on this one. Bring it with you! My husband needs time to think and think about the taste!
LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_MELODY_REOFFER : I took the sacred scroll and carried it from the dark room to the guardian of the tomb. I love to hear you sing. Cat! Come in, poor weaver's children! Do not let those disgusting hooves touch this holy book for a moment!

SONG_KNIGHT_MEET_1 : Stand up, my protector. This weapon works perfectly. Faithful, your protector is faithful to this commandment. Is Gold the Prophet of the Desert? He's not in control, but the curiosity is deep-rooted. Roy sees himself as a protector. What is his work? It is our eternal duty to guard the sacred citadel of Shi-Shi and its voice. That's what I thought. But Gull, look around you. While Roy slept, the castle collapsed and the voice stopped. This is death, or rather, certain death. Others say that looking at the corpse of the state is stupid and pointless. Has Roy always been devoted to his duty?

SURFACE_EDGE_REPEAT : It has been decided. I can't leave here. I have to go see if the parameter has been issued or not.
SONG_KNIGHT_RESTING_MEET : O shining gold, these are signs of war. Is hunting the damned enough, even ruling the castle? It is the eternal duty of guardians and to protect the holy cities with their voices. Whoever is caught in whispering silk will die.
SURFACE_EDGE : A vast desert awaited me... I made a decision. After completing the journey into the darkness, I cannot leave these creatures. We have to go back and delete it.
LIBRARIAN_CLOSED_FIRST : Safe and sound, take care. You may be certified for your future work, but until this project is completed, you cannot move forward. My Lord... This guardian is no fool. He has lived long enough for his allies to fall, but he lives. Science is now a reality. This contract is bound to your vision, as well as ours and the weavers of the young patron. In this holy city, through triumph and fall, the guardian's knowledge, and the hidden itself, are steeped in history. He must find a pillar and build it. This is a great insight into crystallization. Bring this protector, and only to him. There is no one left in this city with such a articulate and zealous patron.
COG_STATUE_ALL_TALK_A : Enchant us with your songs, Milnor, pilgrims of the eternal Faram. Then ascend to the heights and worship the Sacred Heart in our kingdom.

LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_MELODY : Undertaker, in this dark underground room I found a collection of hymns. A strange song must have been cut into it. Now I want you to act. Cacoart! He entered the Pope's hall and stole the hymns! Where is your glory gone, son of the weaver? We deserve the honor of the dead, what a shameful admission you have made! Undertaker, your patience is as weak now as it was yesterday. You can ignore this collection and remain silent, or you can demand answers.
BROOD_MOTHER_TINY_REPEAT : Eggs, eggs! I'll give you lots of clean eggs! That's how you get the big eggs to eat!
LAST_CONDUCTOR_WEAVERS : Attack! Your judgments are wonderful, but it is clear that you have no authority here. Pilgrims, is the land so broken? Once we heard about our emperor's will and it shook our camp. But these words are empty. He kept the kingdom by the greed of the first, the weakest of the lighthouses, the cheap weavers. Now, in this silence, we share the truth in the castle. This kingdom once belonged to a single prince. We raise our voice and protest. Pilgrim, do you see your picture? From the castle at the top? Let's go up to the peak, where we seek to hide and worship the true ruler of the land. Sooner or later, worm, I will rise to meet your master.
SONG_KNIGHT_RESTING_REPEAT : The room has been vacated. A security guard will be present at all times.
GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_HAS : My husband, I brought food for dinner. Finally! God is hungry and sick. Show me your strength.
SLAB_PRISONER_TALK2 : Tell me about the men who guard this building. Aren't those the squirrels of the herd? Squirrel...? They are squirrels. Once they desecrated the kingdom.

SLAB_PRISONER_TALK1 : Although this place is sacred, there is no trace of it. It was once a prison, now it is deserted. let me go Go to the cave and find a place to live. Do I really have to leave this place? Oh, a wonderful and terrible idea! Such a shame. I can hide here from the shame of sin until time wears it out. Are you going to this place...? Please! Kill me before I abuse you again!
LAST_CONDUCTOR_REPEAT : The position of the leader is very important. If you knew the price in advance, would you accept the job?
SLAB_PRISONER_MEET : Song...? Did you come up with a song? Are you from the castle? Run... run? I am alone. I'm not afraid. I didn't escape the camp. Are you their prisoner? Prisoner...? I don't understand what you are saying. This is not a prison. This is the temple of indulgence. Please speak respectfully.
COG_STATUE_ARCHITECT_TALK_B : When we sing, our song becomes a source of nourishment for the eternal world.
COG_STATUE_ARCHITECT_TALK_A : You will listen to the song of architects in the palace. While others remain silent, they will preserve the kingdom, the walls, the tables and the voices.
GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_CORAL : Crunchy walnuts! They seem old and useless, right? But if you chop them small, they have a tangible effect.
MELODY_PICKUP_HINT_NOTMET : For the melody in this volume, we must first find an instrument to play it on. It's not over. Such an instrument must be hidden somewhere. It must be searched carefully.
TORMENTED_TROBBIO_MEET : Yes! Poor thing, poor thing! We have been chosen for the end of destiny! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Listen! It was a fatal blow. Beautiful Faram cries and mourns the end. Very few have survived the tragedies that have befallen us. Let us finally gather here and light the flame. Let us share the pain of the state, find our burning shell and deeply understand its pain and suffering.
LAST_CONDUCTOR_GIVE : Our song, composed of silk threads... Those wonderful sounds have long since disappeared from our room. Keep your tune, my traveler. But you already know the last one.
COG_STATUE_CONDUCTOR_TALK_A : The conductors blare from the towers. They carry the heaviest burdens and lead this nation to eternal glory.
LAST_CONDUCTOR_MEET : Guests? Nothing special. I'm sorry I couldn't be with you. I've been sick for a long time and can't get out of bed. Mi Haji, I hope you give us a worthy guest for our latest insect culture. I have endured a year at your house... Well... I apologize. And now, unfortunately, if you have asked for help or understanding, I fear I will disappoint you again. Whatever you want, all I can offer you is my music. A gentle and light service, but perhaps much more valuable, seldom heard in these quiet times.
SLAB_PRISONER_REPEAT : If the weight of your transgressions weighs you down, repent, my brother.
SLAB_PRISONER_NEEDOLIN : Ah... your song. I have been silent for too long. Please teach me... are all your songs interesting? Has your hearing faded over time? This art is new to me and my resources are limited, but your grace is priceless. Ah! How beautiful it is! My fatigue can almost be painful. But maybe that pain is part of pain. Keep playing; I want to be with you today. Forgive me if I lose my voice.
LIBRARIAN_MELODY_NOPLAY : Are you not playing with our holy air? What are you doing, Obama? Are you afraid of the truth that will come out? Are you not a despicable creature to be feared? When the time comes, Guardian Guardian, I will be ready for you. Your task now is to protect the pillar. If you fail, you will be punished by my sword.
LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_PROMPT_PLURAL : Can you give me the number of hymns?
GOURMAND_SERVANT_MOSSSTEW : The base is a gelatinous soup with moss and berries, and it is a recipe for a sure druidic art, which has deep roots in the moss caves.
