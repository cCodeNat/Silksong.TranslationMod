SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_REOFFER : Do you want gifts? You are so generous! Don't you understand that you can't go on without my help?
SEAMSTRESS_REPEAT : Nora Kane, I appreciate your kindness. I will help you in any way I can. Forgive me for abusing your authority. You may not be happy, but it is best to avoid anger.
ANT_MERCHANT_REPEAT : Black oak green?
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_REMEET : Again? It's been a crazy adventure, full of twists and turns. But since it's a holiday, why not share the crown?
SEAMSTRESS_EXTRA_LORE_2_ALT : I don't want to spoil the surprise, but I can't help but be surprised. Do you know why they hunt you? Are they hall bugs? I have seen the palace and the forms, but I doubt it... They hunt me because of my nature. Because of the silk that flows from your arms. Not for me, but for them, it's perfect. Yes! YES. On the stage, your rare ability is infinitely valuable. The ability to control souls through threads. Souls and silk are deeply connected. A talent that has almost disappeared from the scene. Weaver once had this ability, but now it's dead. Those who are at the top of this realm... They share my nature, or at least to some extent. I have seen your silk in action in the great library. They take fragile weapons and many gears, and weapons they give false life. Hmm... It seems you have seen the truth far beyond my understanding. It's so close, I can't even fathom it. And indeed the courage for something so difficult... Come on! Let's go! Your style and silk are beautiful, but if you pay too much attention to them, you will be angry!
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_ACCEPT : It is a wise choice. Go and pick a thorn. It is important to move quickly. Sure, the guests are friendly, but if you stay longer, you'll see insects in the palace.
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_OFFER : If you want to get out of such a low place, you need some refreshment. And I am a useful animal. I go into the cave behind the house. The insect is developed inside with excellent stingers, flexible yet strong. Go and come back with me. If you do, I'll change your robe to something much quicker.
ANT_QUEEN_BG_MEET : A blue and white monster... wreaking havoc... We feel it a lot! It could be... expensive... it could be
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_HANDIN_ASK : "Okay! I hear voices and whispers under the cloak and the hunt was a success. You will immediately work on removing the thorns."
ANT_QUEEN_BG_REPEAT : If you can, save this blue and white monster...
RESTING_PILGRIM_REPEAT : Ugh...I'm so tired. But it's a shame to leave.
HUNTRESS_QUEST_DECLINE : All right, Spider. First, make sure your organs are fine.
SEAMSTRESS_VISITED_CITADEL : Ah! James the puppy. Can you tell me how your trip went? I climbed the hill and looked at the castle and its grounds. This place was once forgotten... a golden cemetery buried under silken ruins, centuries of oblivion. Through my subjects who conspired to capture me, I now clearly sense the source of your connection and your alien power... Ah! So don't worry! It's so close I didn't want to dig. But do they really have the courage to solve such a difficult problem... Hurry up! You better come here. Of course you will run into serious problems. I don't want to go near her when the trouble starts!
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_TOOLPOUCH : Your bag... with some wood and some crafting I can add pockets so you can store more tools etc. This is cute, isn't it?
HUNTRESS_REPEAT : Even these mountains do not want to share their lot with reptiles. No matter how much I push, scratch or squeeze them, they are my pride! What little they eat will be the best source of nutrition for my hair.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK_DELIVERY_POST : Accept these gems as a reward for your work, or you will become a burden.
HUNTRESS_QUEST_ACCEPT : I am a hunter; don't be afraid But you can bring back the corpses of those you kill. That's right, Spider! Kebabs, sandwiches, fried! Take it all away. We need a lot to feed our son. You can cook any meat you want with my tools. Fortunately, I found some weapons in your area. Quick, spider, before the baby is born. Complete your mission as soon as possible. Then slaughter will be rewarded.
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_REPEAT : "Woman, I'll give you the spine right away. Wonderful, wonderful! The cave in front of you is full of creatures floating freely in the hot air. Your magnificent blow will split it in half."
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_WEIGHTED_ANKLET : Keeping the peace is a sacred duty. You will conquer others, but you will be alone.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_CANCEL : I don't want to change? Isn't it difficult to carry the rosary while traveling?
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_COMPLETE : Excellent! That's good. Wait a minute. The plane is there.
ANT_MERCHANT_MEET : Lucky Walking machine! I'm sorry, I know you've made a lot of mistakes, but yours seems strange to me. Ka... Ka Mak. Green...? Green? The ones you collected are war items. Do you want to exchange them? Knock... Knock!
SEAMSTRESS_ACT_3_REPEAT : Come on, Nora Cat! Your argument hurts everyone... wouldn't the next step lead to a more peaceful solution?
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_SHARD_POUCH : Even these small details can create something beautiful if you have the right vision to design them.
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_HANDIN_REFUSE : In this way you will leave me your possessions. Don't you believe it? You are a fool. Filling your pockets won't do you any good!
SEAMSTRESS_WEARING_ORDER_BADGE : How beautiful are Magnifica's robes! I hope you don't have to have her killed. Tailor, this badge was proudly given to you. And rightly so, as a reward for a hard-fought duel. And at no cost? Huh? So one of your sisters joined the militia? Their wild style seems a bit toned down over the years. Although I miss the old traditions... the habits and the memories... they are still worth preserving.
ANT_MERCHANT_SHARD_POUCH_DESC : Thank you and respect.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_PURCHASED : Yes, it is better. If you agree with my assessment, you will definitely be happy.
SEAMSTRESS_MEET_ALT : "No, you're too annoying! No, don't say that! You're too strange. What's the point? Who's watching! Are they chasing you? Are they hunting you? You must see the palace as a legitimate prey. You say, madam. The insects hiding in the palace brought me here. I asked someone who can sincerely and as strongly and convincingly explain why I'm such a strong and convincing dog now!
RESTING_PILGRIM_DAZED : Aaaaaaaaaaaa...
HUNTRESS_QUEST_REPEAT : Spider, I'm waiting for the food. Bring it on. The kids just need to eat and come back later.
HUNTRESS_MEET : Hmm...
SEAMSTRESS_ACT_3_MEET : Nora Gum! Things have gotten worse since they finally disappeared. It's harder now! The whole world trembles, sighs turn into black threads! Is it your fault that I don't want to be one of them? It is beyond me. And I'm trying to disable the site. I was sure of it! Of course it was your fault. I was hoping you would fix everything. But you yourself have lost everything! Hurry, hurry! Make a decision quickly! The scale of the conflict is so great that now we are all victims.
H_RUNT_QUEST_ACCEPT_LACK_TOOLS : Maybe one day I'll be able to cook, Soya. First of all, you need the right tools. I cannot fully fulfill your wishes with my current arsenal. Hmm... It's about time, right? Will they help us soon? Sharp claws... hard scales... we'll be brothers...
H_RUNT_QUEST_COMPLETE : So... now we are grown up... and some... like our grandchildren... are gone... all... have moved on long ago... If this country remains, I hope you too find your place here.
HUNTRESS_QUEST_ACCEPT_LACK_TOOLS : Wait, we don't export our organs, but you can bring the bodies of the dead. Well done, Spider! I've been cut. Fried and split! Bring everything. We have to provide for our grandchildren. Your needs are immense. First you must get the tools. Our current arsenal may not satisfy your needs. Our young are hatching from the spiders. Find the tools. Finish your work quickly and reap the rewards of slaughter.
ANT_MERCHANT_CURVE_CLAWS_DESC : Look here! Bye! Keep it up.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_RUCKUS : Oh monster! How cruelly will he punish us! Why does the immaculate stranger suffer so much? Tell me, what is this? Is there a law that compels us all to endure hardship in the hope of happiness? Don't read this waste, but follow your instincts. We must survive with our own strength and ingenuity. Neither do I! If what you say is true, I can go eat. So don't worry! Do what you want, but do not despise your strength? Do here and live long enough for most of your aliens to do the same. Unfortunately, neither do I. It's just luck that brought me here and I'm going to rely on it from now on.
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_DECLINE : Come on, village dogs. If it were not for art, it would be difficult to cross this field.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK_DELIVERY : Pilgrim's Guide: Belhart has offered food and drink to travelers passing through this inn. They are truly helpful... and it seems our prayers were not in vain. These orders will fulfill many wishes.
HUNTRESS_QUEST_REOFFER : Don't donate organs to your children, they will do it again at birth.
H_RUNT_MEET_QUEST_ACTIVE : Your mother promised me my organs. She's dead now, but I'll give them to you if there's compensation. Food...? ...With us... Yes, hunter! I have a gift.
H_RUNT_REPEAT : We are also...getting older...we become more carefree...it's hard...
SEAMSTRESS_EXTRA_LORE_2 : I don't want to spoil the surprise, but my curiosity is insatiable. Do you know why they hunt you? Palatine snakes? I'm not sure, but I have a strong suspicion... that they are following my nature. Silk is extracted from the shell. Yes! Absolutely! Finally, your rare talent is infinitely valuable. The art of weaving souls into threads. Soul and silk are intertwined. A skill that has almost disappeared from the scene. The ancient weavers had this art, but now they are extinct. This kingdom is full of people who share my heritage: or part of it. I have seen her as my silk. I have seen the skulls of the most famous people. I've seen her wandering around, totally in control. This thread has a will, and it seems to come from above. Palace... hmm... you have good foresight. This palace... all its ways, all its answers await you. And the long scan is left for you. Come on! It's time to go! Your kindness and silk are lovely, but if you stay any longer I will be bored!
H_RUNT_QUEST_COMPLETE_DECLINE : You multiply… you need meat, you need hunters… you need courage… just like everyone else.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_LOCKET : Memories weigh so heavily on us and some strangers cling to them like an uncomfortable obsession. These memories are not yours, but they may be useful to you.
ANT_MERCHANT_FRACTURED_MASK_DESC : All good. All good.
H_RUNT_QUEST_REOFFER : The need for food... the hunter... will find...
H_RUNT_QUEST_COMPLETE_PRE : Did you smell meat...? ...Will it make us stronger brothers?
H_RUNT_QUEST_ACCEPT : Some of my recipes cook the food exactly how you want it, stupidly. You will wish. Perished! Will we really grow? Sharp claws... hard shells...
SEAMSTRESS_EXTRA_LORE_1 : Wait a moment before you run away!
HUNTRESS_QUEST_COMPLETE : Oh, what nonsense! My children are growing up on this delicious food. Isn't it better to eat other people's organs than your own? No wonder Mr Shota understood my point. How many times have I seen your children? They are born hungry, with sharp teeth and claws. Men, maddened by the desire to multiply, become as content with their flesh as insects. This party is a party, hoping to save the shells. Is it a shame? A mother who does not sacrifice herself for the growth of the child? Is it bad to wish? The first flight to see, the first kill? Kill him and raise him? It's your grandmother's wish. I have no control. I've seen enough killing. I have nothing to do with this performance.
ANT_QUEEN_HASMELODY_FLOWER_OWNED : The blue monster ... comes with destruction ... you can sense the time ... Lord, do not see my current hero, but the hero of old, whose heart shines and beats powerfully before the blue ruler. Waves! Look at me... monster... distant memory... virtue gone...
ANT_QUEEN_HASMELODY_REPEAT : My power... My power... Can you move it, Blue Monster? Are you powerful?... Unlock it together, awesome...
H_RUNT_QUEST_REPEAT : Give me meat... hunter... lots of meat... we will be strong...
SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_AFTER_GET : Ms. Seamstress, great job. Your improvements will be available. I hope so. You rarely get to practice sewing as fine as the warrior, and I appreciate the improvements. Now run away, Miss Mia. And be careful not to die. I don't want to lose my job.
HUNTRESS_TALK_CITADEL : Have you seen any spiders? I'm very hungry, but it doesn't look like I'm here.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK_REPEAT : Pilgrims, living and dead, are nourished. Participation is a sign of affection, especially for those who give.
HUNTRESS_QUEST_OFFER : Hi everyone! Our little one needs lots of food... Do you want to feed him your stomach or yours? Or give him warm oyster shells for Christmas?
HUNTRESS_QUEST_COMPLETE_PRE : Spiders, there it is! The smell coursing through your veins, your limbs are ready to celebrate.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_MEET : Do you want to rest your tired body? The ascent is tireless and even the most devout have their limits. I admire all those who have come this far without sharpening their weapons. Truly. You are lucky to have made it this far. More successful than most. Or is faith alone the difference between success and failure? What then can you give to rest? If you have a rosary, I want it to be well received.
H_RUNT_QUEST_OFFER : Hunter... Wait... We also need a lot of food.
SEAMSTRESS_MEET : No, you're not cool! No, don't say that! You're just weird, aren't you? Look! Are they hunting you? Are they hunting you? You will find valuable loot in the palace. As you said, ma'am. A secret insect led me to these lands. Now I'm looking for them, looking for answers. Ah! How cruel! These are dark times, but if you are a seeker determined to find them, things will surely change for the better. Excellent! I have no sympathy for this holy order, but the state of this kingdom grieves me. If you want to resolve the situation, can I help?
H_RUNT_MEET : Predator... burning claws... immortal... as thin as my skull. This is not correct. They were bigger and stronger... they cheered and fled. Look at the son. The body of the great mother nourishes the child. Let him be ours. Maybe we are too divided, no more... mother, body... and life... for my stronger brothers... for us, for the little ones, for us again...
ANT_QUEEN_HASMELODY : The blue beast... Blue brings destruction... Let's hear it... write the last cycle of tremendous power... If you bring power... my power will disappear... Whoever dies... will remain. I want to remember you instead as a man. I know my intentions are precious, I want to embrace this heartbeat. I only ask you to save this land, rid it of this evil disease born of the void and the void. Waves! If... cattle... if before me... power... haughty... cruel...
H_RUNT_QUEST_DECLINE : The fate of your country is so desperate that you are wrong. I can't even help you with your progress now. Hunters live, kill and live only for themselves, like brothers...
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK2 : A hot, harsh plain, a terrible place for strangers. Above lies the desert: the once wild land is now ravaged by rain, mud and hail. The country hurts us on all sides, but this test. First, the splendor of virtue. Our destiny is our reward. Finding a home in this paradise was easy.
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK1 : Is this your home or your campsite? We do not have a pilgrimage home. We only have one way. We climb, we suffer and we are punished for it. I will stay here for a short time to prepare for my funeral. If I collect enough gems, I will become a saint who can climb without fear.
SEAMSTRESS_MET_PINSTRESS : Across the stage I met someone just like you. Given your home, your clothes, and your strengths, could there be a connection between you? Ah! I met my sister. At least she served her time. I'm glad she's still alive. The last man to uphold the ancient Phoenician traditions... Ah, I can no longer adhere to such cruel values. I'm lost, I warn you. My sister may appear intelligent and charming, but deep down she has the soul of a murderer.
HUNTRESS_QUEST_COMPLETE_DECLINE : Could you, spider, take away the power of your offspring? O cruel beast! Don't need it in your shell?
PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_COINSET_S : We collect your króna for a small fee. It is best if you have a set.
RESTING_PILGRIM_MEET : Ah... Sister, I feel like my spine is breaking. I hear voices... I can't say a word. The road will be very difficult, sister. Since we can't leave this trip, let's at least give ourselves a little rest. Ah... but, sister, trouble lurks on every side. If we rest too much they will catch us. Because... that's the theme of the song.
